        <section>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to present the four Gospels (Jesus 
            words and acts) in an attractive and easy to understand way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The building blocks are events. Thus if an event is described 
            by multiple authors then all of those descriptions are grouped and 
            available in parallel. This grouping is called synoptic Gospels.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of this well-known synoptic grouping, the events are listed 
            in chronological order mainly based on the thoughts shared on the 
            website 
            <a 
              target="_blank" 
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="http://4gospels.info/"
            >
              4gospels.info.<span 
                style="display: inline-block; transform: scale(-1,1);">⇱</span>
            </a> 
            There are many alterations regarding the timeline, 
            however, the basic principle that organising the events based on feasts, 
            has been greatly utilised. Time is referenced in weeks and clearly 
            displayed throughout the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            An interactive map helps in visualising the events in space. The location 
            of the event visited for the last time is being highlighted on the map. 
            Nothing proves more clearly the need of a map than that the events of 
            "Jesus Helps A Non-Jewish Woman" (week 18-31) and "The Ten Lepers" (week 33) 
            are both positioned elsewhere in the timeline in line with common sense 
            and human capacities.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are both overlappings and conflicts between parallel Gospels. For a 
            smooth reading experience, wherever multiple author's descriptions are 
            available, the most complete and logically sound writing has been ordered 
            into the first position. These authors are displayed in [brackets]. Where 
            completeness and logic could only be guaranteed by multiple authors, then 
            an extra description has been created by merging verses together from these
            authors. The merge is strictly full-verse based. No verses have been partially 
            picked ever. These merged descriptions are named [Default]. The merging is 
            the reason for displaying verses with full reference (author, chapter, verse) 
            instead of verse numbers only.

          <p>
            Chronological order can be made in more than one way. 
            Merging verses of the same event from multiple 
            authors in a way that they provide completeness and a smooth 
            reading experience at the same time, is also not straightforward. 
            Locations and reference week ranges are not always obvious either. 
            Main titles, subtitles are also subjective.
            We can make the content of this site really good together only.

            With the following alterations:

              <li>
                <p>
                  Wherever word "spirit" is used in positive meaning, 
                the "szellem" has been replaced by "lélek" in line with the 
                Hungarian common sense. E.g.: szellemidézés, szelleműzés, 
                szellemváros, but(!) 
                lélekgondozás, lelkiismeret, lélekmentő, lélekvándorlás,
                a lelkére beszél,...
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The family name of Maria Magdalene can be translated to Hungarian 
                in two ways: someone from the village of Magdala or as a first name: 
                "Magdolna". Wherever "from Magdala" is used it has been replaced 
                by "Magdolna".
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In ERV-HU, some verses are merged with dashed verse references 
                (e.g. 12-13) in line with common  sense and/or for better 
                understanding. However, due to the operation of the web site 
                builder program, the verses must be standalone. The separation 
                has required some translation which uses either the same words 
                as the original or if this was not possible then the words of 
                the Hungarian New Translation (NT-HU), Copyright © 1975, 1990
