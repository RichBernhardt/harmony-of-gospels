His mother Mary was engaged(d) to marry Joseph, but before they married, she learned she was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.","Because Mary’s husband, Joseph, was a good man, he did not want to disgrace her in public, so he planned to divorce her secretly.","While Joseph thought about these things, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the baby in her is from the Holy Spirit.","She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus,(e) because he will save his people from their sins.”","All this happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet:","“The virgin will be pregnant. She will have a son, and they will name him Immanuel,”(f) which means “God is with us.”","When Joseph woke up, he did what the Lord’s angel had told him to do. Joseph took Mary as his wife,","but he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to the son. And Joseph named him Jesus."],["Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea during the time when Herod was king. When Jesus was born, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.","They asked, “Where is the baby who was born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”","When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, as were all the people in Jerusalem.","Herod called a meeting of all the leading priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Christ would be born.","They answered, “In the town of Bethlehem in Judea. The prophet wrote about this in the Scriptures:","‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,\n    are not just an insignificant village in Judah.\nA ruler will come from you\n    who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel.’”\n(Micah 5:2)","Then Herod had a secret meeting with the wise men and learned from them the exact time they first saw the star.","He sent the wise men to Bethlehem, saying, “Look carefully for the child. When you find him, come tell me so I can worship him too.”","After the wise men heard the king, they left. The star that they had seen in the east went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was.","When the wise men saw the star, they were filled with joy.","They came to the house where the child was and saw him with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their gifts and gave him treasures of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.","But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod, so they returned to their own country by a different way.","After they left, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt, because Herod is starting to look for the child so he can kill him. Stay in Egypt until I tell you to return.”","So Joseph got up and left for Egypt during the night with the child and his mother.","And Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died. This happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet: “I called my son out of Egypt.”(g)","When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him, he was furious. So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and in the surrounding area who were two years old or younger. This was in keeping with the time he learned from the wise men.","So what God had said through the prophet Jeremiah came true:","“A voice was heard in Ramah\n    of painful crying and deep sadness:\nRachel crying for her children.\n    She refused to be comforted,\n    because her children are dead.”\n(Jeremiah 31:15)","After Herod died, an angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt.","The angel said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, because the people who were trying to kill the child are now dead.”","So Joseph took the child and his mother and went to Israel.","But he heard that Archelaus was now king in Judea since his father Herod had died. So Joseph was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the area of Galilee,","to a town called Nazareth, and lived there. And so what God had said through the prophets came true: “He will be called a Nazarene.”(h)"],["About that time John the Baptist began preaching in the desert area of Judea.","John said, “Change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is near.”","John the Baptist is the one Isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said:\n“This is a voice of one\n    who calls out in the desert:\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord.\n    Make the road straight for him.’”\n(Isaiah 40:3)","John’s clothes were made from camel’s hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food, he ate locusts and wild honey.","Many people came from Jerusalem and Judea and all the area around the Jordan River to hear John.","They confessed their sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan River.","Many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the place where John was baptizing people. When John saw them, he said, “You are snakes! Who warned you to run away from God’s coming punishment?","Do the things that show you really have changed your hearts and lives.","And don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you that God could make children for Abraham from these rocks.","The ax is now ready to cut down the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.(i)","“I baptize you with water to show that your hearts and lives have changed. But there is one coming after me who is greater than I am, whose sandals I am not good enough to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.","He will come ready to clean the grain, separating the good grain from the chaff. He will put the good part of the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out.”(j)","At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River and wanted John to baptize him.","But John tried to stop him, saying, “Why do you come to me to be baptized? I need to be baptized by you!”","Jesus answered, “Let it be this way for now. We should do all things that are God’s will.” So John agreed to baptize Jesus.","As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. Then heaven opened, and he saw God’s Spirit coming down on him like a dove.","And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with him.”"],["Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil.","Jesus fasted for forty days and nights. After this, he was very hungry.","The devil came to Jesus to tempt him, saying, “If you are the Son of God, tell these rocks to become bread.”","Jesus answered, “It is written in the Scriptures, ‘A person lives not on bread alone, but by everything God says.’”(k)","Then the devil led Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple.","The devil said, “If you are the Son of God, jump down, because it is written in the Scriptures:\n‘He has put his angels in charge of you.\n    They will catch you in their hands\nso that you will not hit your foot on a rock.’”\n(Psalm 91:11 - 12)","Jesus answered him, “It also says in the Scriptures, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’”(l)","Then the devil led Jesus to the top of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all their splendor.","The devil said, “If you will bow down and worship me, I will give you all these things.”","Jesus said to the devil, “Go away from me, Satan! It is written in the Scriptures, ‘You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”(m)","So the devil left Jesus, and angels came and took care of him.","When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went back to Galilee.","He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, a town near Lake Galilee, in the area near Zebulun and Naphtali.","Jesus did this to bring about what the prophet Isaiah had said:","“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali\n    along the sea,\nbeyond the Jordan River.\n    This is Galilee where the non - Jewish people live.","These people who live in darkness\n    will see a great light.\nThey live in a place covered with the shadows of death,\n    but a light will shine on them.”\n(Isaiah 9:1 - 2)","From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Change your hearts and lives, because the kingdom of heaven is near.”","As Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (called Peter) and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen.","Jesus said, “Come follow me, and I will make you fish for people.”","So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him.","As Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee, he saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus told them to come with him.","Immediately they left the boat and their father, and they followed Jesus.","Jesus went everywhere in Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the Good News about the kingdom of heaven, and healing all the people’s diseases and sicknesses.","The news about Jesus spread all over Syria, and people brought all the sick to him. They were suffering from different kinds of diseases. Some were in great pain, some had demons, some were epileptics,(n) and some were paralyzed. Jesus healed all of them.","Many people from Galilee, the Ten Towns,(o) Jerusalem, Judea, and the land across the Jordan River followed him."],["When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hill and sat down. His followers came to him,","and he began to teach them, saying:","“They are blessed who realize their spiritual poverty,\n    for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.","They are blessed who grieve,\n    for God will comfort them.","They are blessed who are humble,\n    for the whole earth will be theirs.","They are blessed who hunger and thirst after justice,\n    for they will be satisfied.","They are blessed who show mercy to others,\n    for God will show mercy to them.","They are blessed whose thoughts are pure,\n    for they will see God.","They are blessed who work for peace,\n    for they will be called God’s children.","They are blessed who are persecuted for doing good,\n    for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.","“People will insult you and hurt you. They will lie and say all kinds of evil things about you because you follow me. But when they do, you will be blessed.","Rejoice and be glad, because you have a great reward waiting for you in heaven. People did the same evil things to the prophets who lived before you.","“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its salty taste, it cannot be made salty again. It is good for nothing, except to be thrown out and walked on.","“You are the light that gives light to the world. A city that is built on a hill cannot be hidden.","And people don’t hide a light under a bowl. They put it on a lampstand so the light shines for all the people in the house.","In the same way, you should be a light for other people. Live so that they will see the good things you do and will praise your Father in heaven.","“Don’t think that I have come to destroy the law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to bring about what they said.","I tell you the truth, nothing will disappear from the law until heaven and earth are gone. Not even the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will be lost until everything has happened.","Whoever refuses to obey any command and teaches other people not to obey that command will be the least important in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys the commands and teaches other people to obey them will be great in the kingdom of heaven.","I tell you that if you are no more obedient than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","“You have heard that it was said to our people long ago, ‘You must not murder anyone.(p) Anyone who murders another will be judged.’","But I tell you, if you are angry with a brother or sister,(q) you will be judged. If you say bad things to a brother or sister, you will be judged by the council. And if you call someone a fool, you will be in danger of the fire of hell.","“So when you offer your gift to God at the altar, and you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,","leave your gift there at the altar.

It is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell.","If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.","“It was also said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written divorce paper.’(s)","But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife forces her to be guilty of adultery. The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if she has sexual relations with another man.

But Jesus warned them strongly, saying, “Don’t tell anyone about this.”","But the blind men left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area.","When the two men were leaving, some people brought another man to Jesus. This man could not talk because he had a demon in him.","After Jesus forced the demon to leave the man, he was able to speak. The crowd was amazed and said, “We have never seen anything like this in Israel.”","But the Pharisees said, “The prince of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out.”","Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News about the kingdom, and healing all kinds of diseases and sicknesses.","When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them because they were hurting and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.","Jesus said to his followers, “There are many people to harvest but only a few workers to help harvest them.","Pray to the Lord, who owns the harvest, that he will send more workers to gather his harvest.”(ag)"],["Jesus called his twelve followers together and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness.","These are the names of the twelve apostles: Simon (also called Peter), and his brother Andrew, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John,","Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,","Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who turned against Jesus.","Jesus sent out these twelve men with the following order: “Don’t go to the non - Jewish people or to any town where the Samaritans live.","But go to the people of Israel, who are like lost sheep.","When you go, preach this: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’","Heal the sick, raise the dead to life again, heal those who have skin diseases, and force demons out of people. I give you these powers freely, so help other people freely.","Don’t carry any money with you - gold or silver or copper.","Don’t carry a bag or extra clothes or sandals or a walking stick. Workers should be given what they need.","“When you enter a city or town, find some worthy person there and stay in that home until you leave.","When you enter that home, say, ‘Peace be with you.’","If the people there welcome you, let your peace stay there. But if they don’t welcome you, take back the peace you wished for them.","And if a home or town refuses to welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake its dust off your feet.(ah)","I tell you the truth, on the Judgment Day it will be better for the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah(ai) than for the people of that town.","“Listen, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as clever as snakes and as innocent as doves.","Be careful of people, because they will arrest you and take you to court and whip you in their synagogues.","Because of me you will be taken to stand before governors and kings, and you will tell them and the non - Jewish people about me.","When you are arrested, don’t worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given the things to say.","It will not really be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.","“Brothers will give their own brothers to be killed, and fathers will give their own children to be killed. Children will fight against their own parents and have them put to death.","All people will hate you because you follow me, but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved.","When you are treated badly in one city, run to another city. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through all the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.","“A student is not better than his teacher, and a servant is not better than his master.","A student should be satisfied to become like his teacher; a servant should be satisfied to become like his master. If the head of the family is called Beelzebul, then the other members of the family will be called worse names!","“So don’t be afraid of those people, because everything that is hidden will be shown. Everything that is secret will be made known.","I tell you these things in the dark, but I want you to tell them in the light. What you hear whispered in your ear you should shout from the housetops.","Don’t be afraid of people, who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul. The only one you should fear is the one who can destroy the soul and the body in hell.","Two sparrows cost only a penny, but not even one of them can die without your Father’s knowing it.","God even knows how many hairs are on your head.","So don’t be afraid. You are worth much more than many sparrows.","“All those who stand before others and say they believe in me, I will say before my Father in heaven that they belong to me.","But all who stand before others and say they do not believe in me, I will say before my Father in heaven that they do not belong to me.","“Don’t think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.","I have come so that\n‘a son will be against his father,\n    a daughter will be against her mother,\na daughter - in - law will be against her mother - in - law.","A person’s enemies will be members of his own family.’\n(Micah 7:6)","“Those who love their father or mother more than they love me are not worthy to be my followers.

Those who give up their lives for me will hold on to true life.","Whoever accepts you also accepts me, and whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me.","Whoever meets a prophet and accepts him will receive the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a good person because that person is good will receive the reward of a good person.","Those who give one of these little ones a cup of cold water because they are my followers will truly get their reward.”"],["After Jesus finished telling these things to his twelve followers, he left there and went to the towns in Galilee to teach and preach.","John the Baptist was in prison, but he heard about what the Christ was doing. So John sent some of his followers to Jesus.","They asked him, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?”","Jesus answered them, “Go tell John what you hear and see:","The blind can see, the crippled can walk, and people with skin diseases are healed. The deaf can hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is preached to the poor.","Those who do not stumble in their faith because of me are blessed.”","As John’s followers were leaving, Jesus began talking to the people about John. Jesus said, “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed(aj) blown by the wind?","What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes live in kings’ palaces.","So why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, and I tell you, John is more than a prophet.","This was written about him:\n‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare the way for you.’\n(Malachi 3:1)","I tell you the truth, John the Baptist is greater than any other person ever born, but even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.","Since the time John the Baptist came until now, the kingdom of heaven has been going forward in strength, and people have been trying to take it by force.","All the prophets and the law of Moses told about what would happen until the time John came.","And if you will believe what they said, you will believe that John is Elijah, whom they said would come.","Let those with ears use them and listen!","“What can I say about the people of this time? What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace, who call out to each other,","‘We played music for you, but you did not dance;\n    we sang a sad song, but you did not cry.’","John came and did not eat or drink like other people. So people say, ‘He has a demon.’","The Son of Man came, eating and drinking, and people say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine, and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved to be right by what she does.”","Then Jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles, because the people did not change their lives and stop sinning.","He said, “How terrible for you, Korazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! If the same miracles I did in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon,(ak) those people would have changed their lives a long time ago. They would have worn rough cloth and put ashes on themselves to show they had changed.","But I tell you, on the Judgment Day it will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you, Capernaum,(al) will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to the depths. If the miracles I did in you had happened in Sodom,(am) its people would have stopped sinning, and it would still be a city today.","But I tell you, on the Judgment Day it will be better for Sodom than for you.”","At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the people who are wise and smart. But you have shown them to those who are like little children.","Yes, Father, this is what you really wanted.","“My Father has given me all things. No one knows the Son, except the Father.

His followers were hungry, so they began to pick the grain and eat it.","When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, “Look! Your followers are doing what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath day.”","Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and the people with him were hungry?","He went into God’s house, and he and those with him ate the holy bread, which was lawful only for priests to eat.","And have you not read in the law of Moses that on every Sabbath day the priests in the Temple break this law about the Sabbath day? But the priests are not wrong for doing that.","I tell you that there is something here that is greater than the Temple.","The Scripture says, ‘I want kindness more than I want animal sacrifices.’(an) You don’t really know what those words mean. If you understood them, you would not judge those who have done nothing wrong.","“So the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.”","Jesus left there and went into their synagogue,","where there was a man with a crippled hand. They were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they asked him, “Is it right to heal on the Sabbath day?”(ao)","Jesus answered, “If any of you has a sheep, and it falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day, you will help it out of the ditch.","Surely a human being is more important than a sheep. So it is lawful to do good things on the Sabbath day.”","Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it became well again, like the other hand.","But the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus.","Jesus knew what the Pharisees were doing, so he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all who were sick.","But Jesus warned the people not to tell who he was.","He did these things to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said:","“Here is my servant whom I have chosen.\n    I love him, and I am pleased with him.\nI will put my Spirit upon him,\n    and he will tell of my justice to all people.","He will not argue or cry out;\n    no one will hear his voice in the streets.","He will not break a crushed blade of grass\n    or put out even a weak flame\nuntil he makes justice win the victory.","In him will the non - Jewish people find hope.”\n(Isaiah 42:1 - 4)","Then some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk, because he had a demon. Jesus healed the man so that he could talk and see.","All the people were amazed and said, “Perhaps this man is the Son of David!”","When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, to force demons out of people.”","Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking, so he said to them, “Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed. And any city or family that is divided against itself will not continue.","And if Satan forces out himself, then Satan is divided against himself, and his kingdom will not continue.","You say that I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons. If that is true, then what power do your people use to force out demons? So they will be your judges.","But if I use the power of God’s Spirit to force out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.","“If anyone wants to enter a strong person’s house and steal his things, he must first tie up the strong person. Then he can steal the things from the house.","“Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not work with me is working against me.","So I tell you, people can be forgiven for every sin and everything they say against God.

If your tree is not good, it will have bad fruit. A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces.","You snakes! You are evil people, so how can you say anything good? The mouth speaks the things that are in the heart.","Good people have good things in their hearts, and so they say good things. But evil people have evil in their hearts, so they say evil things.","And I tell you that on the Judgment Day people will be responsible for every careless thing they have said.","The words you have said will be used to judge you. Some of your words will prove you right, but some of your words will prove you guilty.”","Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus, saying, “Teacher, we want to see you work a miracle as a sign.”","Jesus answered, “Evil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle for a sign. But no sign will be given to them, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.","Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights. In the same way, the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights.","On the Judgment Day the people from Nineveh(ap) will stand up with you people who live now, and they will show that you are guilty. When Jonah preached to them, they were sorry and changed their lives. And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here.","On the Judgment Day, the Queen of the South(aq) will stand up with you people who live today. She will show that you are guilty, because she came from far away to listen to Solomon’s wise teaching. And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here.","“When an evil spirit comes out of a person, it travels through dry places, looking for a place to rest, but it doesn’t find it.","So the spirit says, ‘I will go back to the house I left.’ When the spirit comes back, it finds the house still empty, swept clean, and made neat.","Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits even more evil than it is, and they go in and live there. So the person has even more trouble than before. It is the same way with the evil people who live today.”","While Jesus was talking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside, trying to find a way to talk to him.","Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, and they want to talk to you.”(ar)","He answered, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”","Then he pointed to his followers and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.","My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what my Father in heaven wants.”"],["That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.","Large crowds gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down, while the people stood on the shore.","Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things. He said: “A farmer went out to plant his seed.","While he was planting, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it all up.","Some seed fell on rocky ground, where there wasn’t much dirt. That seed grew very fast, because the ground was not deep.","But when the sun rose, the plants dried up, because they did not have deep roots.","Some other seed fell among thorny weeds, which grew and choked the good plants.","Some other seed fell on good ground where it grew and produced a crop. Some plants made a hundred times more, some made sixty times more, and some made thirty times more.","Let those with ears use them and listen.”","The followers came to Jesus and asked, “Why do you use stories to teach the people?”","Jesus answered, “You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of heaven, but others cannot know these secrets.","Those who have understanding will be given more, and they will have all they need. But those who do not have understanding, even what they have will be taken away from them.","This is why I use stories to teach the people: They see, but they don’t really see. They hear, but they don’t really hear or understand.","So they show that the things Isaiah said about them are true:\n‘You will listen and listen, but you will not understand.\n    You will look and look, but you will not learn.","For the minds of these people have become stubborn.\n    They do not hear with their ears,\n    and they have closed their eyes.\nOtherwise they might really understand\n    what they see with their eyes\n    and hear with their ears.\nThey might really understand in their minds\n    and come back to me and be healed.’\n(Isaiah 6:9 - 10)","But you are blessed, because you see with your eyes and hear with your ears.","I tell you the truth, many prophets and good people wanted to see the things that you now see, but they did not see them. And they wanted to hear the things that you now hear, but they did not hear them.","“So listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer.","What is the seed that fell by the road? That seed is like the person who hears the message about the kingdom but does not understand it. The Evil One comes and takes away what was planted in that person’s heart.","And what is the seed that fell on rocky ground? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and quickly accepts it with joy.","But he does not let the teaching go deep into his life, so he keeps it only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching he accepted, he quickly gives up.","And what is the seed that fell among the thorny weeds? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching but lets worries about this life and the temptation of wealth stop that teaching from growing. So the teaching does not produce fruit(as) in that person’s life.","But what is the seed that fell on the good ground? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and understands it. That person grows and produces fruit, sometimes a hundred times more, sometimes sixty times more, and sometimes thirty times more.”","Then Jesus told them another story: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field.","That night, when everyone was asleep, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left.","Later, the wheat sprouted and the heads of grain grew, but the weeds also grew.","Then the man’s servants came to him and said, ‘You planted good seed in your field. Where did the weeds come from?’","The man answered, ‘An enemy planted weeds.’ The servants asked, ‘Do you want us to pull up the weeds?’","The man answered, ‘No, because when you pull up the weeds, you might also pull up the wheat.","Let the weeds and the wheat grow together until the harvest time. At harvest time I will tell the workers, “First gather the weeds and tie them together to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it to my barn.”’”","Then Jesus told another story: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field.","That seed is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows, it is one of the largest garden plants. It becomes big enough for the wild birds to come and build nests in its branches.”","Then Jesus told another story: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise.”","Jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people; he always used stories to teach them.","This is as the prophet said:\n“I will speak using stories;\n    I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made.”\n(Psalm 78:2)","Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His followers came to him and said, “Explain to us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field.”","Jesus answered, “The man who planted the good seed in the field is the Son of Man.","The field is the world, and the good seed are all of God’s children who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those people who belong to the Evil One.","And the enemy who planted the bad seed is the devil. The harvest time is the end of the age, and the workers who gather are God’s angels.","“Just as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.","The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all who cause sin and all who do evil.","The angels will throw them into the blazing furnace, where the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain.","Then the good people will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those with ears use them and listen.","“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. One day a man found the treasure, and then he hid it in the field again. He was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned to buy that field.","“Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a man looking for fine pearls.","When he found a very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.","“Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was put into the lake and caught many different kinds of fish.","When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net to the shore. They sat down and put all the good fish in baskets and threw away the bad fish.","It will be this way at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the evil people from the good people.","The angels will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace, where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain.”","Jesus asked his followers, “Do you understand all these things?”\nThey answered, “Yes, we understand.”","Then Jesus said to them, “So every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings out both new things and old things he has saved.”","When Jesus finished teaching with these stories, he left there.","He went to his hometown and taught the people in the synagogue, and they were amazed. They said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and this power to do miracles?","He is just the son of a carpenter. His mother is Mary, and his brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas.","And all his sisters are here with us. Where then does this man get all these things?”","So the people were upset with Jesus.\nBut Jesus said to them, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and in his own home.”","So he did not do many miracles there because they had no faith."],["At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard the reports about Jesus.","So he said to his servants, “Jesus is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead. That is why he can work these miracles.”","Sometime before this, Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him into prison. Herod did this because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, Herod’s brother.","John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to be married to Herodias.”","Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.","On Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, and she pleased him.","So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted.","Herodias told her daughter what to ask for, so she said to Herod, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”","Although King Herod was very sad, he had made a promise, and his dinner guests had heard him. So Herod ordered that what she asked for be done.","He sent soldiers to the prison to cut off John’s head.","And they brought it on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother.","John’s followers came and got his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.","When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he left in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself. But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.","When he arrived, he saw a great crowd waiting. He felt sorry for them and healed those who were sick.","When it was evening, his followers came to him and said, “No one lives in this place, and it is already late. Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves.”","But Jesus answered, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”","They said to him, “But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish.”","Jesus said, “Bring the bread and the fish to me.”","Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking to heaven, he thanked God for the food. Jesus divided the bread and gave it to his followers, who gave it to the people.","All the people ate and were satisfied. Then the followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of food.","There were about five thousand men there who ate, not counting women and children.","Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the lake. He stayed there to send the people home.","After he had sent them away, he went by himself up into the hills to pray. It was late, and Jesus was there alone.","By this time, the boat was already far away from land. It was being hit by waves, because the wind was blowing against it.","Between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the water.","When his followers saw him walking on the water, they were afraid. They said, “It’s a ghost!” and cried out in fear.","But Jesus quickly spoke to them, “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”","Peter said, “Lord, if it is really you, then command me to come to you on the water.”","Jesus said, “Come.”\nAnd Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus.","But when Peter saw the wind and the waves, he became afraid and began to sink. He shouted, “Lord, save me!”","Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught Peter. Jesus said, “Your faith is small. Why did you doubt?”","After they got into the boat, the wind became calm.","Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, “Truly you are the Son of God!”","When they had crossed the lake, they came to shore at Gennesaret.","When the people there recognized Jesus, they told people all around there that Jesus had come, and they brought all their sick to him.","They begged Jesus to let them touch just the edge of his coat, and all who touched it were healed."],["Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked him,","“Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us? They don’t wash their hands before they eat.”","Jesus answered, “And why do you refuse to obey God’s command so that you can follow your own teachings?","God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’(at) and ‘Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death.’(au)","But you say a person can tell his father or mother, ‘I have something I could use to help you, but I have given it to God already.’","You teach that person not to honor his father or his mother. You rejected what God said for the sake of your own rules.","You are hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he said about you:","‘These people show honor to me with words,\n    but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is worthless.\n    The things they teach are nothing but human rules.’”\n(Isaiah 29:13)","After Jesus called the crowd to him, he said, “Listen and understand what I am saying.","It is not what people put into their mouths that makes them unclean. It is what comes out of their mouths that makes them unclean.”","Then his followers came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees are angry because of what you said?”","Jesus answered, “Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted himself will be pulled up by the roots.","Stay away from the Pharisees; they are blind leaders.(av) And if a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a ditch.”","Peter said, “Explain the example to us.”","Jesus said, “Do you still not understand?","Surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then goes out of the body.","But what people say with their mouths comes from the way they think; these are the things that make people unclean.","Out of the mind come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual sins, stealing, lying, and speaking evil of others.","These things make people unclean; eating with unwashed hands does not make them unclean.”","Jesus left that place and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.","A Canaanite woman from that area came to Jesus and cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter has a demon, and she is suffering very much.”","But Jesus did not answer the woman. So his followers came to Jesus and begged him, “Tell the woman to go away. She is following us and shouting.”","Jesus answered, “God sent me only to the lost sheep, the people of Israel.”","Then the woman came to Jesus again and bowed before him and said, “Lord, help me!”","Jesus answered, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs.”","The woman said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”","Then Jesus answered, “Woman, you have great faith! I will do what you asked.” And at that moment the woman’s daughter was healed.","After leaving there, Jesus went along the shore of Lake Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat there.","Great crowds came to Jesus, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those who could not speak, and many others. They put them at Jesus’ feet, and he healed them.","The crowd was amazed when they saw that people who could not speak before were now able to speak. The crippled were made strong. The lame could walk, and the blind could see.

I don’t want to send them away hungry. They might faint while going home.”","His followers asked him, “How can we get enough bread to feed all these people? We are far away from any town.”","Jesus asked, “How many loaves of bread do you have?”\nThey answered, “Seven, and a few small fish.”","Jesus told the people to sit on the ground.","He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks to God.

Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food.","There were about four thousand men there who ate, besides women and children.","After sending the people home, Jesus got into the boat and went to the area of Magadan."],["The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus, wanting to trick him. So they asked him to show them a miracle from God.","Jesus answered,(aw) “At sunset you say we will have good weather, because the sky is red.","And in the morning you say that it will be a rainy day, because the sky is dark and red. You see these signs in the sky and know what they mean.

Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”","His followers discussed the meaning of this, saying, “He said this because we forgot to bring bread.”","Knowing what they were talking about, Jesus asked them, “Why are you talking about not having bread?

Others say you are Elijah, and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”","Then Jesus asked them, “And who do you say I am?”","Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”","Jesus answered, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because no person taught you that.

Those things will never happen to you!”","Then Jesus said to Peter, “Go away from me, Satan!(az) You are not helping me! You don’t care about the things of God, but only about the things people think are important.”","Then Jesus said to his followers, “If people want to follow me, they must give up the things they want. They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me.","Those who want to save their lives will give up true life, and those who give up their lives for me will have true life.","It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls.

A voice came from the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!”","When his followers heard the voice, they were so frightened they fell to the ground.","But Jesus went to them and touched them and said, “Stand up. Don’t be afraid.”","When they looked up, they saw Jesus was now alone.","As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.","Then his followers asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”","Jesus answered, “They are right to say that Elijah is coming and that he will make everything the way it should be.","But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they wanted to do. It will be the same with the Son of Man; those same people will make the Son of Man suffer.”","Then the followers understood that Jesus was talking about John the Baptist.","When Jesus and his followers came back to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and bowed before him.","The man said, “Lord, have mercy on my son. He has epilepsy(bb) and is suffering very much, because he often falls into the fire or into the water.","I brought him to your followers, but they could not cure him.”","Jesus answered, “You people have no faith, and your lives are all wrong. How long must I put up with you? How long must I continue to be patient with you? Bring the boy here.”","Jesus commanded the demon inside the boy. Then the demon came out, and the boy was healed from that time on.","The followers came to Jesus when he was alone and asked, “Why couldn’t we force the demon out?”","Jesus answered, “Because your faith is too small.

That’s your problem, not ours.”","So Judas threw the money into the Temple. Then he went off and hanged himself.","The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said, “Our law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money, because it has paid for a man’s death.”","So they decided to use the coins to buy Potter’s Field as a place to bury strangers who died in Jerusalem.","That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood.","So what Jeremiah the prophet had said came true: “They took thirty silver coins.

What wrong has he done?”\nBut they shouted louder, “Crucify him!”","When Pilate saw that he could do nothing about this and that a riot was starting, he took some water and washed his hands(d) in front of the crowd. Then he said, “I am not guilty of this man’s death. You are the ones who are causing it!”","All the people answered, “We and our children will be responsible for his death.”","Then he set Barabbas free. But Jesus was beaten with whips and handed over to the soldiers to be crucified.","The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace, and they all gathered around him.","They took off his clothes and put a red robe on him.","Using thorny branches, they made a crown, put it on his head, and put a stick in his right hand. Then the soldiers bowed before Jesus and made fun of him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”","They spat on Jesus. Then they took his stick and began to beat him on the head.","After they finished, the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.","As the soldiers were going out of the city with Jesus, they forced a man from Cyrene, named Simon, to carry the cross for Jesus.","They all came to the place called Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull.","The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with gall(e) to drink. He tasted the wine but refused to drink it.","When the soldiers had crucified him, they threw lots to decide who would get his clothes.(f)","The soldiers sat there and continued watching him.","They put a sign above Jesus’ head with a charge against him. It said: this is jesus, the king of the jews.","Two robbers were crucified beside Jesus, one on the right and the other on the left.","People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads,","saying, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days. So save yourself! Come down from that cross if you are really the Son of God!”","The leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders were also making fun of Jesus.","They said, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself! He says he is the king of Israel! If he is the king, let him come down now from the cross. Then we will believe in him.","He trusts in God, so let God save him now, if God really wants him. He himself said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”","And in the same way, the robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him.","At noon the whole country became dark, and the darkness lasted for three hours.","About three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” This means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”","Some of the people standing there who heard this said, “He is calling Elijah.”","Quickly one of them ran and got a sponge and filled it with vinegar and tied it to a stick and gave it to Jesus to drink.","But the others said, “Don’t bother him. We want to see if Elijah will come to save him.”","But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and died.","Then the curtain in the Temple(g) was torn into two pieces, from the top to the bottom. Also, the earth shook and rocks broke apart.","The graves opened, and many of God’s people who had died were raised from the dead.","They came out of the graves after Jesus was raised from the dead and went into the holy city, where they appeared to many people.","When the army officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw this earthquake and everything else that happened, they were very frightened and said, “He really was the Son of God!”","Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to help him were standing at a distance from the cross, watching.","Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John were there.","That evening a rich man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the town of Arimathea, came to Jerusalem.","Joseph went to Pilate and asked to have Jesus’ body. So Pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give it to Joseph.","Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.","He put Jesus’ body in a new tomb that he had cut out of a wall of rock, and he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb. Then Joseph went away.","Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary were sitting near the tomb.","The next day, the day after Preparation Day, the leading priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.","They said, “Sir, we remember that while that liar was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise from the dead.’","So give the order for the tomb to be guarded closely till the third day. Otherwise, his followers might come and steal the body and tell people that he has risen from the dead. That lie would be even worse than the first one.”","Pilate said, “Take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know.”","So they all went to the tomb and made it safe from thieves by sealing the stone in the entrance and putting soldiers there to guard it."],["The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week. At dawn on the first day, Mary Magdalene and another woman named Mary went to look at the tomb.","At that time there was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven, went to the tomb, and rolled the stone away from the entrance. Then he sat on the stone.","He was shining as bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.","The soldiers guarding the tomb shook with fear because of the angel, and they became like dead men.","The angel said to the women, “Don’t be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who has been crucified.","He is not here. He has risen from the dead as he said he would. Come and see the place where his body was.","And go quickly and tell his followers, ‘Jesus has risen from the dead. He is going into Galilee ahead of you, and you will see him there.’” Then the angel said, “Now I have told you.”","The women left the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were also very happy. They ran to tell Jesus’ followers what had happened.","Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings.” The women came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.","Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go and tell my followers to go on to Galilee, and they will see me there.”","While the women went to tell Jesus’ followers, some of the soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city to tell the leading priests everything that had happened.","Then the priests met with the elders and made a plan. They paid the soldiers a large amount of money","and said to them, “Tell the people that Jesus’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were asleep.","If the governor hears about this, we will satisfy him and save you from trouble.”","So the soldiers kept the money and did as they were told. And that story is still spread among the people even today.","The eleven followers went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.","On the mountain they saw Jesus and worshiped him, but some of them did not believe it was really Jesus.","Then Jesus came to them and said, “All power in heaven and on earth is given to me.","So go and make followers of all people in the world. Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.","Teach them to obey everything that I have taught you, and I will be with you always, even until the end of this age.”"]],mk:[["This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God,(a)","as the prophet Isaiah wrote:\n“I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way.”\n(Malachi 3:1)","“This is a voice of one\n    who calls out in the desert:\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord.\n    Make the road straight for him.’”\n(Isaiah 40:3)","John was baptizing people in the desert and preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins.","All the people from Judea and Jerusalem were going out to him. They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.","John wore clothes made from camel’s hair, had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.","This is what John preached to the people: “There is one coming after me who is greater than I; I am not good enough even to kneel down and untie his sandals.","I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”","At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.","Immediately, as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven open. The Holy Spirit came down on him like a dove,","and a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with you.”","Then the Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.","He was in the desert forty days and was tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels came and took care of him.","After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the Good News from God.","He said, “The right time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Change your hearts and lives and believe the Good News!”","When Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee, he saw Simon(b) and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen.","Jesus said to them, “Come follow me, and I will make you fish for people.”","So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him.","Going a little farther, Jesus saw two more brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat, mending their nets.","Jesus immediately called them, and they left their father in the boat with the hired workers and followed Jesus.","Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day He went to the synagogue and began to teach.","The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught like a person who had authority, not like their teachers of the law.","Just then, a man was there in the synagogue who had an evil spirit in him. He shouted,","“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are - God’s Holy One!”","Jesus commanded the evil spirit, “Be quiet! Come out of the man!”","The evil spirit shook the man violently, gave a loud cry, and then came out of him.","The people were so amazed they asked each other, “What is happening here? This man is teaching something new, and with authority. He even gives commands to evil spirits, and they obey him.”","And the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee.","As soon as Jesus and his followers left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon(c) and Andrew.","Simon’s mother - in - law was sick in bed with a fever, and the people told Jesus about her.","So Jesus went to her bed, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.","That evening, after the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and had demons in them.","The whole town gathered at the door.","Jesus healed many who had different kinds of sicknesses, and he forced many demons to leave people. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.","Early the next morning, while it was still dark, Jesus woke and left the house. He went to a lonely place, where he prayed.","Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.","When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you!”","Jesus answered, “We should go to other towns around here so I can preach there too. That is the reason I came.”","So he went everywhere in Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and forcing out demons.","A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He fell to his knees and begged Jesus, “You can heal me if you will.”","Jesus felt sorry for the man, so he reached out his hand and touched him and said, “I will. Be healed!”","Immediately the disease left the man, and he was healed.","Jesus told the man to go away at once, but he warned him strongly,","“Don’t tell anyone about this. But go and show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well.(d) This will show the people what I have done.”","The man left there, but he began to tell everyone that Jesus had healed him, and so he spread the news about Jesus. As a result, Jesus could not enter a town if people saw him. He stayed in places where nobody lived, but people came to him from everywhere."],["A few days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home.","Many people gathered together so that there was no room in the house, not even outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them God’s message.","Four people came, carrying a paralyzed man.","Since they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd, they dug a hole in the roof right above where he was speaking. When they got through, they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man on it.","When Jesus saw the faith of these people, he said to the paralyzed man, “Young man, your sins are forgiven.”","Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,","“Why does this man say things like that? He is speaking as if he were God. Only God can forgive sins.”","Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking. So he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?","Which is easier: to tell this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to tell him, ‘Stand up. Take your mat and walk’?","But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man,","“I tell you, stand up, take your mat, and go home.”","Immediately the paralyzed man stood up, took his mat, and walked out while everyone was watching him.\nThe people were amazed and praised God. They said, “We have never seen anything like this!”","Jesus went to the lake again. The whole crowd followed him there, and he taught them.","While he was walking along, he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax collector’s booth. Jesus said to him, “Follow me,” and he stood up and followed Jesus.","Later, as Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and “sinners” were eating there with Jesus and his followers. Many people like this followed Jesus.","When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with the tax collectors and “sinners,” they asked his followers, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”","Jesus heard this and said to them, “It is not the healthy people who need a doctor, but the sick. I did not come to invite good people but to invite sinners.”","Now the followers of John(e) and the Pharisees often fasted(f) for a certain time. Some people came to Jesus and said, “Why do John’s followers and the followers of the Pharisees often fast, but your followers don’t?”","Jesus answered, “The friends of the bridegroom do not fast while the bridegroom is still with them. As long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast.","But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.","“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old coat. Otherwise, the patch will shrink and pull away - the new patch will pull away from the old coat. Then the hole will be worse.","Also, no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags. Otherwise, the new wine will break the bags, and the wine will be ruined along with the bags. But new wine should be put into new leather bags.”","One Sabbath day, as Jesus was walking through some fields of grain, his followers began to pick some grain to eat.","The Pharisees said to Jesus, “Why are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”","Jesus answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and those with him were hungry and needed food?","During the time of Abiathar the high priest, David went into God’s house and ate the holy bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And David also gave some of the bread to those who were with him.”","Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, “The Sabbath day was made to help people; they were not made to be ruled by the Sabbath day.","So then, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.”"],["Another time when Jesus went into a synagogue, a man with a crippled hand was there.","Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him.","Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, “Stand up here in the middle of everyone.”","Then Jesus asked the people, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to kill?” But they said nothing to answer him.","Jesus was angry as he looked at the people, and he felt very sad because they were stubborn. Then he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand and it was healed.","Then the Pharisees left and began making plans with the Herodians(g) about a way to kill Jesus.","Jesus left with his followers for the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.","Also many people came from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from the lands across the Jordan River, and from the area of Tyre and Sidon. When they heard what Jesus was doing, many people came to him.","When Jesus saw the crowds, he told his followers to get a boat ready for him to keep people from crowding against him.","He had healed many people, so all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him.","When evil spirits saw Jesus, they fell down before him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”","But Jesus strongly warned them not to tell who he was.","Then Jesus went up on a mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.","Jesus chose twelve and called them apostles.(h) He wanted them to be with him, and he wanted to send them out to preach","and to have the authority to force demons out of people.","These are the twelve men he chose: Simon (Jesus named him Peter),","James and John the sons of Zebedee (Jesus named them Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”),","Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,","and Judas Iscariot who later turned against Jesus.","Then Jesus went home, but again a crowd gathered. There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat.","When his family heard this, they went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind.","But the teachers of the law from Jerusalem were saying, “Beelzebul is living inside him! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people.”","So Jesus called the people together and taught them with stories. He said, “Satan will not force himself out of people.","A kingdom that is divided cannot continue,","and a family that is divided cannot continue.","And if Satan is against himself and fights against his own people, he cannot continue; that is the end of Satan.","No one can enter a strong person’s house and steal his things unless he first ties up the strong person. Then he can steal things from the house.","I tell you the truth, all sins that people do and all the things people say against God can be forgiven.","But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of a sin that continues forever.”","Jesus said this because the teachers of the law said that he had an evil spirit inside him.","Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to tell him to come out.","Many people were sitting around Jesus, and they said to him, “Your mother and brothers(i) are waiting for you outside.”","Jesus asked, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”","Then he looked at those sitting around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!","My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants.”"],["Again Jesus began teaching by the lake. A great crowd gathered around him, so he sat down in a boat near the shore. All the people stayed on the shore close to the water.","Jesus taught them many things, using stories. He said,","“Listen! A farmer went out to plant his seed.","While he was planting, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it up.","Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn’t much dirt. That seed grew very fast, because the ground was not deep.","But when the sun rose, the plants dried up because they did not have deep roots.","Some other seed fell among thorny weeds, which grew and choked the good plants. So those plants did not produce a crop.","Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow. It got taller and produced a crop. Some plants made thirty times more, some made sixty times more, and some made a hundred times more.”","Then Jesus said, “Let those with ears use them and listen!”","Later, when Jesus was alone, the twelve apostles and others around him asked him about the stories.","Jesus said, “You can know the secret about the kingdom of God. But to other people I tell everything by using stories","so that:\n‘They will look and look, but they will not learn.\n    They will listen and listen, but they will not understand.\nIf they did learn and understand,\n    they would come back to me and be forgiven.’”\n(Isaiah 6:9 - 10)","Then Jesus said to his followers, “Don’t you understand this story? If you don’t, how will you understand any story?","The farmer is like a person who plants God’s message in people.","Sometimes the teaching falls on the road. This is like the people who hear the teaching of God, but Satan quickly comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them.","Others are like the seed planted on rocky ground. They hear the teaching and quickly accept it with joy.","But since they don’t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives, they keep it only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted, they quickly give up.","Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds. They hear the teaching,","but the worries of this life, the temptation of wealth, and many other evil desires keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit(j) in their lives.","Others are like the seed planted in the good ground. They hear the teaching and accept it. Then they grow and produce fruit - sometimes thirty times more, sometimes sixty times more, and sometimes a hundred times more.”","Then Jesus said to them, “Do you hide a lamp under a bowl or under a bed? No! You put the lamp on a lampstand.","Everything that is hidden will be made clear and every secret thing will be made known.","Let those with ears use them and listen!","“Think carefully about what you hear. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you, but God will give you even more.","Those who have understanding will be given more. But those who do not have understanding, even what they have will be taken away from them.”","Then Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who plants seed in the ground.","Night and day, whether the person is asleep or awake, the seed still grows, but the person does not know how it grows.","By itself the earth produces grain. First the plant grows, then the head, and then all the grain in the head.","When the grain is ready, the farmer cuts it, because this is the harvest time.”","Then Jesus said, “How can I show you what the kingdom of God is like? What story can I use to explain it?","The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed, the smallest seed you plant in the ground.","But when planted, this seed grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants. It produces large branches, and the wild birds can make nests in its shade.”","Jesus used many stories like these to teach the crowd God’s message - as much as they could understand.","He always used stories to teach them. But when he and his followers were alone, Jesus explained everything to them.","That evening, Jesus said to his followers, “Let’s go across the lake.”","Leaving the crowd behind, they took him in the boat just as he was. There were also other boats with them.","A very strong wind came up on the lake. The waves came over the sides and into the boat so that it was already full of water.","Jesus was at the back of the boat, sleeping with his head on a cushion. His followers woke him and said, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are drowning!”","Jesus stood up and commanded the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind stopped, and it became completely calm.","Jesus said to his followers, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”","The followers were very afraid and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”"],["Jesus and his followers went to the other side of the lake to the area of the Gerasene(k) people.","When Jesus got out of the boat, instantly a man with an evil spirit came to him from the burial caves.","This man lived in the caves, and no one could tie him up, not even with a chain.","Many times people had used chains to tie the man’s hands and feet, but he always broke them off. No one was strong enough to control him.","Day and night he would wander around the burial caves and on the hills, screaming and cutting himself with stones.","While Jesus was still far away, the man saw him, ran to him, and fell down before him.","The man shouted in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I command you in God’s name not to torture me!”","He said this because Jesus was saying to him, “You evil spirit, come out of the man.”","Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\nHe answered, “My name is Legion,(l) because we are many spirits.”","He begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that area.","A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill near there.","The demons begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs; let us go into them.”","So Jesus allowed them to do this. The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs. Then the herd of pigs - about two thousand of them - rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned.","The herdsmen ran away and went to the town and to the countryside, telling everyone about this. So people went out to see what had happened.","They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to have the many evil spirits, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind. And they were frightened.","The people who saw this told the others what had happened to the man who had the demons living in him, and they told about the pigs.","Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area.","As Jesus was getting back into the boat, the man who was freed from the demons begged to go with him.","But Jesus would not let him. He said, “Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.”","So the man left and began to tell the people in the Ten Towns(m) about what Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.","When Jesus went in the boat back to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him there.","A leader of the synagogue, named Jairus, came there, saw Jesus, and fell at his feet.","He begged Jesus, saying again and again, “My daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so she will be healed and will live.”","So Jesus went with him.\nA large crowd followed Jesus and pushed very close around him.","Among them was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years.","She had suffered very much from many doctors and had spent all the money she had, but instead of improving, she was getting worse.","When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his coat.","She thought, “If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”","Instantly her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease.","At once Jesus felt power go out from him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”","His followers said, “Look at how many people are pushing against you! And you ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”","But Jesus continued looking around to see who had touched him.","The woman, knowing that she was healed, came and fell at Jesus’ feet. Shaking with fear, she told him the whole truth.","Jesus said to her, “Dear woman, you are made well because you believed. Go in peace; be healed of your disease.”","While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of the synagogue leader. They said, “Your daughter is dead. There is no need to bother the teacher anymore.”","But Jesus paid no attention to what they said. He told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid; just believe.”","Jesus let only Peter, James, and John the brother of James go with him.","When they came to the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus found many people there making lots of noise and crying loudly.","Jesus entered the house and said to them, “Why are you crying and making so much noise? The child is not dead, only asleep.”","But they laughed at him. So, after throwing them out of the house, Jesus took the child’s father and mother and his three followers into the room where the child was.","Taking hold of the girl’s hand, he said to her, “Talitha, koum!” (This means, “Young girl, I tell you to stand up!”)","At once the girl stood right up and began walking. (She was twelve years old.) Everyone was completely amazed.","Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell people about this. Then he told them to give the girl something to eat."],["Jesus left there and went to his hometown, and his followers went with him.","On the Sabbath day he taught in the synagogue. Many people heard him and were amazed, saying, “Where did this man get these teachings? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And where did he get the power to do miracles?","He is just the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. And his sisters are here with us.” So the people were upset with Jesus.","Jesus said to them, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and with his own people and in his own home.”","So Jesus was not able to work any miracles there except to heal a few sick people by putting his hands on them.","He was amazed at how many people had no faith.\nThen Jesus went to other villages in that area and taught.","He called his twelve followers together and got ready to send them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.","This is what Jesus commanded them: “Take nothing for your trip except a walking stick. Take no bread, no bag, and no money in your pockets.","Wear sandals, but take only the clothes you are wearing.","When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.","If the people in a certain place refuse to welcome you or listen to you, leave that place. Shake its dust off your feet(n) as a warning to them.”(o)","So the followers went out and preached that people should change their hearts and lives.","They forced many demons out and put olive oil on many sick people and healed them.","King Herod heard about Jesus, because he was now well known. Some people said,(p) “He is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead. That is why he can work these miracles.”","Others said, “He is Elijah.”(q)\nOther people said, “Jesus is a prophet, like the prophets who lived long ago.”","When Herod heard this, he said, “I killed John by cutting off his head. Now he has risen from the dead!”","Herod himself had ordered his soldiers to arrest John and put him in prison in order to please his wife, Herodias. She had been the wife of Philip, Herod’s brother, but then Herod had married her.","John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to be married to your brother’s wife.”","So Herodias hated John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn’t,","because Herod was afraid of John and protected him. He knew John was a good and holy man. Also, though John’s preaching always bothered him, he enjoyed listening to John.","Then the perfect time came for Herodias to cause John’s death. On Herod’s birthday, he gave a dinner party for the most important government leaders, the commanders of his army, and the most important people in Galilee.","When the daughter of Herodias(r) came in and danced, she pleased Herod and the people eating with him.\nSo King Herod said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I will give it to you.”","He promised her, “Anything you ask for I will give to you - up to half of my kingdom.”","The girl went to her mother and asked, “What should I ask for?”\nHer mother answered, “Ask for the head of John the Baptist.”","At once the girl went back to the king and said to him, “I want the head of John the Baptist right now on a platter.”","Although the king was very sad, he had made a promise, and his dinner guests had heard it. So he did not want to refuse what she asked.","Immediately the king sent a soldier to bring John’s head. The soldier went and cut off John’s head in the prison","and brought it back on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.","When John’s followers heard this, they came and got John’s body and put it in a tomb.","The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him about all the things they had done and taught.","Crowds of people were coming and going so that Jesus and his followers did not even have time to eat. He said to them, “Come away by yourselves, and we will go to a lonely place to get some rest.”","So they went in a boat by themselves to a lonely place.","But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So from all the towns they ran to the place where Jesus was going, and they got there before him.","When he arrived, he saw a great crowd waiting. He felt sorry for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.","When it was late in the day, his followers came to him and said, “No one lives in this place, and it is already very late.","Send the people away so they can go to the countryside and towns around here to buy themselves something to eat.”","But Jesus answered, “You give them something to eat.”\nThey said to him, “We would all have to work a month to earn enough money to buy that much bread!”","Jesus asked them, “How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.”\nWhen they found out, they said, “Five loaves and two fish.”","Then Jesus told his followers to have the people sit in groups on the green grass.","So they sat in groups of fifty or a hundred.","Jesus took the five loaves and two fish and, looking up to heaven, he thanked God for the food. He divided the bread and gave it to his followers for them to give to the people. Then he divided the two fish among them all.","All the people ate and were satisfied.","The followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish.","There were five thousand men who ate.","Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida across the lake. He stayed there to send the people home.","After sending them away, he went into the hills to pray.","That night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on the land.","He saw his followers struggling hard to row the boat, because the wind was blowing against them. Between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the water, and he wanted to walk past the boat.","But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost and cried out.","They all saw him and were afraid. But quickly Jesus spoke to them and said, “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”","Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind became calm. The followers were greatly amazed.","They did not understand about the miracle of the five loaves, because their minds were closed.","When they had crossed the lake, they came to shore at Gennesaret and tied the boat there.","When they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus.","They ran everywhere in that area and began to bring sick people on mats wherever they heard he was.","And everywhere he went - into towns, cities, or countryside - the people brought the sick to the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch just the edge of his coat, and all who touched it were healed."],["When some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem, they gathered around Jesus.","They saw that some of Jesus’ followers ate food with hands that were not clean, that is, they hadn’t washed them.","(The Pharisees and all the Jews never eat before washing their hands in the way required by their unwritten laws.","And when they buy something in the market, they never eat it until they wash themselves in a special way. They also follow many other unwritten laws, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, and pots.(s))","The Pharisees and the teachers of the law said to Jesus, “Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us? Why do your followers eat their food with hands that are not clean?”","Jesus answered, “Isaiah was right when he spoke about you hypocrites. He wrote,\n‘These people show honor to me with words,\n    but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is worthless.\n    The things they teach are nothing but human rules.’\n(Isaiah 29:13)","You have stopped following the commands of God, and you follow only human teachings.”(t)","Then Jesus said to them, “You cleverly ignore the commands of God so you can follow your own teachings.","Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’(u) and ‘Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death.’(v)","But you say a person can tell his father or mother, ‘I have something I could use to help you, but it is Corban - a gift to God.’","You no longer let that person use that money for his father or his mother.","By your own rules, which you teach people, you are rejecting what God said. And you do many things like that.”","After Jesus called the crowd to him again, he said, “Every person should listen to me and understand what I am saying.","There is nothing people put into their bodies that makes them unclean. People are made unclean by the things that come out of them. [","Let those with ears use them and listen.]”(w)","When Jesus left the people and went into the house, his followers asked him about this story.","Jesus said, “Do you still not understand? Surely you know that nothing that enters someone from the outside can make that person unclean.","It does not go into the mind, but into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.” (When Jesus said this, he meant that no longer was any food unclean for people to eat.)","And Jesus said, “The things that come out of people are the things that make them unclean.","All these evil things begin inside people, in the mind: evil thoughts, sexual sins, stealing, murder, adultery,","greed, evil actions, lying, doing sinful things, jealousy, speaking evil of others, pride, and foolish living.","All these evil things come from inside and make people unclean.”","Jesus left that place and went to the area around Tyre.(x) When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know he was there, but he could not stay hidden.","A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard that he was there. So she quickly came to Jesus and fell at his feet.","She was Greek, born in Phoenicia, in Syria. She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter.","Jesus told the woman, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs. First let the children eat all they want.”","But she answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table can eat the children’s crumbs.”","Then Jesus said, “Because of your answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”","The woman went home and found her daughter lying in bed; the demon was gone.","Then Jesus left the area around Tyre and went through Sidon to Lake Galilee, to the area of the Ten Towns.(y)","While he was there, some people brought a man to him who was deaf and could not talk plainly. The people begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him.","Jesus led the man away from the crowd, by himself. He put his fingers in the man’s ears and then spit and touched the man’s tongue.","Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to the man, “Ephphatha!” (This means, “Be opened.”)","Instantly the man was able to hear and to use his tongue so that he spoke clearly.","Jesus commanded the people not to tell anyone about what happened. But the more he commanded them, the more they told about it.","They were completely amazed and said, “Jesus does everything well. He makes the deaf hear! And those who can’t talk he makes able to speak.”"],["Another time there was a great crowd with Jesus that had nothing to eat. So Jesus called his followers and said,","“I feel sorry for these people, because they have already been with me for three days, and they have nothing to eat.","If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way. Some of them live a long way from here.”","Jesus’ followers answered, “How can we get enough bread to feed all these people? We are far away from any town.”","Jesus asked, “How many loaves of bread do you have?”\nThey answered, “Seven.”","Jesus told the people to sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks to God, and divided the bread. He gave the pieces to his followers to give to the people, and they did so.","The followers also had a few small fish. After Jesus gave thanks for the fish, he told his followers to give them to the people also.","All the people ate and were satisfied. Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food.","There were about four thousand people who ate. After they had eaten, Jesus sent them home.","Then right away he got into a boat with his followers and went to the area of Dalmanutha.","The Pharisees came to Jesus and began to ask him questions. Hoping to trap him, they asked Jesus for a miracle from God.","Jesus sighed deeply and said, “Why do you people ask for a miracle as a sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to you.”","Then Jesus left the Pharisees and went in the boat to the other side of the lake.","His followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat; they had forgotten to bring more.","Jesus warned them, “Be careful! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”","His followers discussed the meaning of this, saying, “He said this because we have no bread.”","Knowing what they were talking about, Jesus asked them, “Why are you talking about not having bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your minds closed?","You have eyes, but you don’t really see. You have ears, but you don’t really listen. Remember when","I divided five loaves of bread for the five thousand? How many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food?”\nThey answered, “Twelve.”","“And when I divided seven loaves of bread for the four thousand, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food?”\nThey answered, “Seven.”","Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand yet?”","Jesus and his followers came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch the man.","So Jesus took the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on the man and asked, “Can you see now?”","The man looked up and said, “Yes, I see people, but they look like trees walking around.”","Again Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then the man opened his eyes wide and they were healed, and he was able to see everything clearly.","Jesus told him to go home, saying, “Don’t go into the town.”(z)","Jesus and his followers went to the towns around Caesarea Philippi. While they were traveling, Jesus asked them, “Who do people say I am?”","They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others say you are Elijah,(aa) and others say you are one of the prophets.”","Then Jesus asked, “But who do you say I am?”\nPeter answered, “You are the Christ.”","Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone who he was.","Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and that he would be rejected by the Jewish elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law. He told them that the Son of Man must be killed and then rise from the dead after three days.","Jesus told them plainly what would happen. Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to tell him not to talk like that.","But Jesus turned and looked at his followers. Then he told Peter not to talk that way. He said, “Go away from me, Satan!(ab) You don’t care about the things of God, but only about things people think are important.”","Then Jesus called the crowd to him, along with his followers. He said, “If people want to follow me, they must give up the things they want. They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me.","Those who want to save their lives will give up true life. But those who give up their lives for me and for the Good News will have true life.","It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls.","They could never pay enough to buy back their souls.","The people who live now are living in a sinful and evil time. If people are ashamed of me and my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes with his Father’s glory and with the holy angels.”"],["Then Jesus said to the people, “I tell you the truth, some people standing here will see the kingdom of God come with power before they die.”","Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up on a high mountain by themselves. While they watched, Jesus’ appearance was changed.","His clothes became shining white, whiter than any person could make them.","Then Elijah and Moses(ac) appeared to them, talking with Jesus.","Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”","Peter did not know what to say, because he and the others were so frightened.","Then a cloud came and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”","Suddenly Peter, James, and John looked around, but they saw only Jesus there alone with them.","As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.","So the followers obeyed Jesus, but they discussed what he meant about rising from the dead.","Then they asked Jesus, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”","Jesus answered, “They are right to say that Elijah must come first and make everything the way it should be. But why does the Scripture say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will treat him as if he were nothing?","I tell you that Elijah has already come. And people did to him whatever they wanted to do, just as the Scriptures said it would happen.”","When Jesus, Peter, James, and John came back to the other followers, they saw a great crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.","But as soon as the crowd saw Jesus, the people were surprised and ran to welcome him.","Jesus asked, “What are you arguing about?”","A man answered, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has an evil spirit in him that stops him from talking.","When the spirit attacks him, it throws him on the ground. Then my son foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes very stiff. I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out, but they couldn’t.”","Jesus answered, “You people have no faith. How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”","So the followers brought him to Jesus. As soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus, it made the boy lose control of himself, and he fell down and rolled on the ground, foaming at the mouth.","Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been happening?”\nThe father answered, “Since he was very young.","The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him. If you can do anything for him, please have pity on us and help us.”","Jesus said to the father, “You said, ‘If you can!’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”","Immediately the father cried out, “I do believe! Help me to believe more!”","When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he ordered the evil spirit, saying, “You spirit that makes people unable to hear or speak, I command you to come out of this boy and never enter him again!”","The evil spirit screamed and caused the boy to fall on the ground again. Then the spirit came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, and many people said, “He is dead!”","But Jesus took hold of the boy’s hand and helped him to stand up.","When Jesus went into the house, his followers began asking him privately, “Why couldn’t we force that evil spirit out?”","Jesus answered, “That kind of spirit can only be forced out by prayer.”(ad)","Then Jesus and his followers left that place and went through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know where he was,","because he was teaching his followers. He said to them, “The Son of Man will be handed over to people, and they will kill him. After three days, he will rise from the dead.”","But the followers did not understand what Jesus meant, and they were afraid to ask him.\nWho Is the Greatest?","Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. When they went into a house there, he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?”","But the followers did not answer, because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest.","Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him. He said, “Whoever wants to be the most important must be last of all and servant of all.”","Then Jesus took a small child and had him stand among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said,","“Whoever accepts a child like this in my name accepts me. And whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me.”","Then John said, “Teacher, we saw someone using your name to force demons out of a person. We told him to stop, because he does not belong to our group.”","But Jesus said, “Don’t stop him, because anyone who uses my name to do powerful things will not easily say evil things about me.","Whoever is not against us is with us.","I tell you the truth, whoever gives you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will truly get his reward.","“If one of these little children believes in me, and someone causes that child to sin, it would be better for that person to have a large stone tied around his neck and be drowned in the sea.","If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and go to hell, where the fire never goes out. [","In hell the worm does not die; the fire is never put out.](ae)","If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to lose part of your body and to live forever than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. [","In hell the worm does not die; the fire is never put out.](af)","If your eye causes you to sin, take it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.","In hell the worm does not die; the fire is never put out.","Every person will be salted with fire.","“Salt is good, but if the salt loses its salty taste, you cannot make it salty again. So, be full of salt, and have peace with each other.”"],["Then Jesus left that place and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River. Again, crowds came to him, and he taught them as he usually did.","Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him. They asked, “Is it right for a man to divorce his wife?”","Jesus answered, “What did Moses command you to do?”","They said, “Moses allowed a man to write out divorce papers and send her away.”(ag)","Jesus said, “Moses wrote that command for you because you were stubborn.","But when God made the world, ‘he made them male and female.’(ah)","‘So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,(ai)","and the two will become one body.’(aj) So there are not two, but one.","God has joined the two together, so no one should separate them.”","Later, in the house, his followers asked Jesus again about the question of divorce.","He answered, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against her.","And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery.”","Some people brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch them, but his followers told them to stop.","When Jesus saw this, he was upset and said to them, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children.","I tell you the truth, you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a little child, or you will never enter it.”","Then Jesus took the children in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.","As Jesus started to leave, a man ran to him and fell on his knees before Jesus. The man asked, “Good teacher, what must I do to have life forever?”","Jesus answered, “Why do you call me good? Only God is good.","You know the commands: ‘You must not murder anyone. You must not be guilty of adultery. You must not steal. You must not tell lies about your neighbor. You must not cheat. Honor your father and mother.’”(ak)","The man said, “Teacher, I have obeyed all these things since I was a boy.”","Jesus, looking at the man, loved him and said, “There is one more thing you need to do. Go and sell everything you have, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.”","He was very sad to hear Jesus say this, and he left sorrowfully, because he was rich.","Then Jesus looked at his followers and said, “How hard it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”","The followers were amazed at what Jesus said. But he said again, “My children, it is very hard(al) to enter the kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”","The followers were even more surprised and said to each other, “Then who can be saved?”","Jesus looked at them and said, “For people this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”","Peter said to Jesus, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”","Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, all those who have left houses, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or farms for me and for the Good News","will get more than they left. Here in this world they will have a hundred times more homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields. And with those things, they will also suffer for their belief. But in this age they will have life forever.","Many who are first now will be last in the future. And many who are last now will be first in the future.”","As Jesus and the people with him were on the road to Jerusalem, he was leading the way. His followers were amazed, but others in the crowd who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and began to tell them what was about to happen in Jerusalem.","He said, “Look, we are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be turned over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law. They will say that he must die, and they will turn him over to the non - Jewish people,","who will laugh at him and spit on him. They will beat him with whips and crucify him. But on the third day, he will rise to life again.”","Then James and John, sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we want to ask you to do something for us.”","Jesus asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”","They answered, “Let one of us sit at your right side and one of us sit at your left side in your glory in your kingdom.”","Jesus said, “You don’t understand what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I must drink? And can you be baptized with the same kind of baptism that I must go through?”(am)","They answered, “Yes, we can.”\nJesus said to them, “You will drink the same cup that I will drink, and you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through.","But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or my left; those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”","When the other ten followers heard this, they began to be angry with James and John.","Jesus called them together and said, “The other nations have rulers. You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people, and their important leaders love to use all their authority.","But it should not be that way among you. Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant.","Whoever wants to become the first among you must serve all of you like a slave.","In the same way, the Son of Man did not come to be served. He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”","Then they came to the town of Jericho. As Jesus was leaving there with his followers and a great many people, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting by the road.","When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”","Many people warned the blind man to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”","Jesus stopped and said, “Tell the man to come here.”\nSo they called the blind man, saying, “Cheer up! Get to your feet. Jesus is calling you.”","The blind man jumped up, left his coat there, and went to Jesus.","Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?”\nThe blind man answered, “Teacher, I want to see.”","Jesus said, “Go, you are healed because you believed.” At once the man could see, and he followed Jesus on the road."],["As Jesus and his followers were coming closer to Jerusalem, they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives. From there Jesus sent two of his followers","and said to them, “Go to the town you can see there. When you enter it, you will quickly find a colt tied, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here to me.","If anyone asks you why you are doing this, tell him its Master needs the colt, and he will send it at once.”","The followers went into the town, found a colt tied in the street near the door of a house, and untied it.","Some people were standing there and asked, “What are you doing? Why are you untying that colt?”","The followers answered the way Jesus told them to answer, and the people let them take the colt.","They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat on it.","Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches in the fields and spread them on the road.","The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him, shouting,\n“Praise God!\nGod bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord!\n(Psalm 118:26)","God bless the kingdom of our father David!\n    That kingdom is coming!\nPraise(an) to God in heaven!”","Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After he had looked at everything, since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve apostles.","The next day as Jesus was leaving Bethany, he became hungry.","Seeing a fig tree in leaf from far away, he went to see if it had any figs on it. But he found no figs, only leaves, because it was not the right season for figs.","So Jesus said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And Jesus’ followers heard him say this.","When Jesus returned to Jerusalem, he went into the Temple and began to throw out those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money, and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves.","Jesus refused to allow anyone to carry goods through the Temple courts.","Then he taught the people, saying, “It is written in the Scriptures, ‘My Temple will be called a house for prayer for people from all nations.’(ao) But you are changing God’s house into a ‘hideout for robbers.’”(ap)","The leading priests and the teachers of the law heard all this and began trying to find a way to kill Jesus. They were afraid of him, because all the people were amazed at his teaching.","That evening, Jesus and his followers(aq) left the city.","The next morning as Jesus was passing by with his followers, they saw the fig tree dry and dead, even to the roots.","Peter remembered the tree and said to Jesus, “Teacher, look! The fig tree you cursed is dry and dead!”","Jesus answered, “Have faith in God.","I tell you the truth, you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, fall into the sea.’ And if you have no doubts in your mind and believe that what you say will happen, God will do it for you.","So I tell you to believe that you have received the things you ask for in prayer, and God will give them to you.","When you are praying, if you are angry with someone, forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also forgive your sins. [","But if you don’t forgive other people, then your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.]”(ar)","Jesus and his followers went again to Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking in the Temple, the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him.","They said to him, “What authority do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”","Jesus answered, “I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you what authority I have to do these things.","Tell me: When John baptized people, was that authority from God or just from other people?”","They argued about Jesus’ question, saying, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ Jesus will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’","But if we say, ‘It was from other people,’ the crowd will be against us.” (These leaders were afraid of the people, because all the people believed that John was a prophet.)","So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”\nJesus said to them, “Then I won’t tell you what authority I have to do these things.”"],["Jesus began to use stories to teach the people. He said, “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it and dug a hole for a winepress and built a tower. Then he leased the land to some farmers and left for a trip.","When it was time for the grapes to be picked, he sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.","But the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him and sent him away empty - handed.","Then the man sent another servant. They hit him on the head and showed no respect for him.","So the man sent another servant, whom they killed. The man sent many other servants; the farmers beat some of them and killed others.","“The man had one person left to send, his son whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’","“But the farmers said to each other, ‘This son will inherit the vineyard. If we kill him, it will be ours.’","So they took the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.","“So what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers.","Surely you have read this Scripture:\n‘The stone that the builders rejected\n    became the cornerstone.","The Lord did this,\n    and it is wonderful to us.’”\n(Psalm 118:22 - 23)","The Jewish leaders knew that the story was about them. So they wanted to find a way to arrest Jesus, but they were afraid of the people. So the leaders left him and went away.\nIs It Right to Pay Taxes or Not?","Later, the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians(as) to Jesus to trap him in saying something wrong.","They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man. You are not afraid of what other people think about you, because you pay no attention to who they are. And you teach the truth about God’s way. Tell us: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?","Should we pay them, or not?”\nBut knowing what these men were really trying to do, Jesus said to them, “Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a coin to look at.”","They gave Jesus a coin, and he asked, “Whose image and name are on the coin?”\nThey answered, “Caesar’s.”","Then Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and give to God the things that are God’s.” The men were amazed at what Jesus said.","Then some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question. (Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead.)","They said, “Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.","Once there were seven brothers. The first brother married and died, leaving no children.","So the second brother married the widow, but he also died and had no children. The same thing happened with the third brother.","All seven brothers married her and died, and none of the brothers had any children. Finally the woman died too.","Since all seven brothers had married her, when people rise from the dead, whose wife will she be?”","Jesus answered, “Why don’t you understand? Don’t you know what the Scriptures say, and don’t you know about the power of God?","When people rise from the dead, they will not marry, nor will they be given to someone to marry. They will be like the angels in heaven.","Surely you have read what God said about people rising from the dead. In the book in which Moses wrote about the burning bush,(at) it says that God told Moses, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’(au)","God is the God of the living, not the dead. You Sadducees are wrong!”","One of the teachers of the law came and heard Jesus arguing with the Sadducees. Seeing that Jesus gave good answers to their questions, he asked Jesus, “Which of the commands is most important?”","Jesus answered, “The most important command is this: ‘Listen, people of Israel! The Lord our God is the only Lord.","Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.’(av)","The second command is this: ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’(aw) There are no commands more important than these.”","The man answered, “That was a good answer, Teacher. You were right when you said God is the only Lord and there is no other God besides him.","One must love God with all his heart, all his mind, and all his strength. And one must love his neighbor as he loves himself. These commands are more important than all the animals and sacrifices we offer to God.”","When Jesus saw that the man answered him wisely, Jesus said to him, “You are close to the kingdom of God.” And after that, no one was brave enough to ask Jesus any more questions.","As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he asked, “Why do the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?","David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, said:\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n“Sit by me at my right side,\n    until I put your enemies under your control.”’\n(Psalm 110:1)","David himself calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ so how can the Christ be his son?” The large crowd listened to Jesus with pleasure.","Jesus continued teaching and said, “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around wearing fancy clothes, and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces.","They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at feasts.","But they cheat widows and steal their houses and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers. They will receive a greater punishment.”","Jesus sat near the Temple money box and watched the people put in their money. Many rich people gave large sums of money.","Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which were only worth a few cents.","Calling his followers to him, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow gave more than all those rich people.","They gave only what they did not need. This woman is very poor, but she gave all she had; she gave all she had to live on.”"],["As Jesus was leaving the Temple, one of his followers said to him, “Look, Teacher! How beautiful the buildings are! How big the stones are!”","Jesus said, “Do you see all these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another. Every stone will be thrown down to the ground.”","Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the Temple, he was alone with Peter, James, John, and Andrew. They asked Jesus,","“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are going to happen?”","Jesus began to answer them, “Be careful that no one fools you.","Many people will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the One,’ and they will fool many people.","When you hear about wars and stories of wars that are coming, don’t be afraid. These things must happen before the end comes.","Nations will fight against other nations, and kingdoms against other kingdoms. There will be earthquakes in different places, and there will be times when there is no food for people to eat. These things are like the first pains when something new is about to be born.","“You must be careful. People will arrest you and take you to court and beat you in their synagogues. You will be forced to stand before kings and governors, to tell them about me. This will happen to you because you follow me.","But before these things happen, the Good News must be told to all people.","When you are arrested and judged, don’t worry ahead of time about what you should say. Say whatever is given you to say at that time, because it will not really be you speaking; it will be the Holy Spirit.","“Brothers will give their own brothers to be killed, and fathers will give their own children to be killed. Children will fight against their own parents and cause them to be put to death.","All people will hate you because you follow me, but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved.","“You will see ‘a blasphemous object that brings destruction’(ax) standing where it should not be.” (You who read this should understand what it means.) “At that time, the people in Judea should run away to the mountains.","If people are on the roofs(ay) of their houses, they must not go down or go inside to get anything out of their houses.","If people are in the fields, they must not go back to get their coats.","At that time, how terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies!","Pray that these things will not happen in winter,","because those days will be full of trouble. There will be more trouble than there has ever been since the beginning, when God made the world, until now, and nothing as bad will ever happen again.","God has decided to make that terrible time short. Otherwise, no one would go on living. But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen.","At that time, someone might say to you, ‘Look, there is the Christ!’ Or another person might say, ‘There he is!’ But don’t believe them.","False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles. They will try to fool even the people God has chosen, if that is possible.","So be careful. I have warned you about all this before it happens.","“During the days after this trouble comes,\n‘the sun will grow dark,\n    and the moon will not give its light.","The stars will fall from the sky.\n    And the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’\n(Isaiah 13:10); 34:4","“Then people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","Then he will send his angels all around the earth to gather his chosen people from every part of the earth and from every part of heaven.","“Learn a lesson from the fig tree: When its branches become green and soft and new leaves appear, you know summer is near.","In the same way, when you see these things happening, you will know that the time is near, ready to come.","I tell you the truth, all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living.","Earth and sky will be destroyed, but the words I have said will never be destroyed.","“No one knows when that day or time will be, not the angels in heaven, not even the Son. Only the Father knows.","Be careful! Always be ready,(az) because you don’t know when that time will be.","It is like a man who goes on a trip. He leaves his house and lets his servants take care of it, giving each one a special job to do. The man tells the servant guarding the door always to be watchful.","So always be ready, because you don’t know when the owner of the house will come back. It might be in the evening, or at midnight, or in the morning while it is still dark, or when the sun rises.","Always be ready. Otherwise he might come back suddenly and find you sleeping.","I tell you this, and I say this to everyone: ‘Be ready!’”"],["It was now only two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a trick to arrest Jesus and kill him.","But they said, “We must not do it during the feast, because the people might cause a riot.”","Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon, who had a skin disease. While Jesus was eating there, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus’ head.","Some who were there became upset and said to each other, “Why waste that perfume?","It was worth a full year’s work. It could have been sold and the money given to the poor.” And they got very angry with the woman.","Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you troubling her? She did an excellent thing for me.","You will always have the poor with you, and you can help them anytime you want. But you will not always have me.","This woman did the only thing she could do for me; she poured perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.","I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached in all the world, what this woman has done will be told, and people will remember her.”","One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests to offer to hand Jesus over to them.","These priests were pleased about this and promised to pay Judas money. So he watched for the best time to turn Jesus in.","It was now the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb was sacrificed. Jesus’ followers said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”","Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them, “Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.","When he goes into a house, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says: “Where is my guest room in which I can eat the Passover meal with my followers?”’","The owner will show you a large room upstairs that is furnished and ready. Prepare the food for us there.”","So the followers left and went into the city. Everything happened as Jesus had said, so they prepared the Passover meal.","In the evening, Jesus went to that house with the twelve.","While they were all eating, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will turn against me - one of you eating with me now.”","The followers were very sad to hear this. Each one began to say to Jesus, “I am not the one, am I?”","Jesus answered, “It is one of the twelve - the one who dips his bread into the bowl with me.","The Son of Man will die, just as the Scriptures say. But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed. It would be better for him if he had never been born.”","While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to his followers and said, “Take it; this is my body.”","Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers, and they all drank from the cup.","Then Jesus said, “This is my blood which is the new(ba) agreement that God makes with his people. This blood is poured out for many.","I tell you the truth, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine(bb) again until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”","After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.","Then Jesus told the followers, “You will all stumble in your faith, because it is written in the Scriptures:\n‘I will kill the shepherd,\n    and the sheep will scatter.’\n(Zechariah 13:7)","But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”","Peter said, “Everyone else may stumble in their faith, but I will not.”","Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, tonight before the rooster crows twice you will say three times you don’t know me.”","But Peter insisted, “I will never say that I don’t know you! I will even die with you!” And all the other followers said the same thing.","Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, “Sit here while I pray.”","Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and he began to be very sad and troubled.","He said to them, “My heart is full of sorrow, to the point of death. Stay here and watch.”","After walking a little farther away from them, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed that, if possible, he would not have this time of suffering.","He prayed, “Abba,(bc) Father! You can do all things. Take away this cup(bd) of suffering. But do what you want, not what I want.”","Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour?","Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation. The spirit wants to do what is right, but the body is weak.”","Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing.","Then he went back to his followers, and again he found them asleep, because their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to say to him.","After Jesus prayed a third time, he went back to his followers and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? That’s enough. The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people.","Get up, we must go. Look, here comes the man who has turned against me.”","At once, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came up. With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders.","Judas had planned a signal for them, saying, “The man I kiss is Jesus. Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away.”","So Judas went straight to Jesus and said, “Teacher!” and kissed him.","Then the people grabbed Jesus and arrested him.","One of his followers standing nearby pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.","Then Jesus said, “You came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal.","Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me there. But all these things have happened to make the Scriptures come true.”","Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away.","A young man, wearing only a linen cloth, was following Jesus, and the people also grabbed him.","But the cloth he was wearing came off, and he ran away naked.","The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest, where all the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law were gathered.","Peter followed far behind and entered the courtyard of the high priest’s house. There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.","The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him. But the council could find no proof of anything.","Many people came and told false things about him, but all said different things - none of them agreed.","Then some people stood up and lied about Jesus, saying,","“We heard this man say, ‘I will destroy this Temple that people made. And three days later, I will build another Temple not made by people.’”","But even the things these people said did not agree.","Then the high priest stood before them and asked Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer? Don’t you have something to say about their charges against you?”","But Jesus said nothing; he did not answer.\nThe high priest asked Jesus another question: “Are you the Christ, the Son of the blessed God?”","Jesus answered, “I am. And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, the Powerful One, and coming on clouds in the sky.”","When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes and said, “We don’t need any more witnesses!","You all heard him say these things against God. What do you think?”\nThey all said that Jesus was guilty and should die.","Some of the people there began to spit at Jesus. They blindfolded him and beat him with their fists and said, “Prove you are a prophet!” Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him.","While Peter was in the courtyard, a servant girl of the high priest came there.","She saw Peter warming himself at the fire and looked closely at him.\nThen she said, “You also were with Jesus, that man from Nazareth.”","But Peter said that he was never with Jesus. He said, “I don’t know or understand what you are talking about.” Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard. And the rooster crowed.(be)","The servant girl saw Peter there, and again she said to the people who were standing nearby, “This man is one of those who followed Jesus.”","Again Peter said that it was not true.\nA short time later, some people were standing near Peter saying, “Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus, because you are from Galilee, too.”","Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”","At once, the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Then Peter lost control of himself and began to cry."],["Very early in the morning, the leading priests, the elders, the teachers of the law, and all the Jewish council decided what to do with Jesus. They tied him, led him away, and turned him over to Pilate, the governor.","Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\nJesus answered, “Those are your words.”","The leading priests accused Jesus of many things.","So Pilate asked Jesus another question, “You can see that they are accusing you of many things. Aren’t you going to answer?”","But Jesus still said nothing, so Pilate was very surprised.","Every year at the time of the Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose.","At that time, there was a man named Barabbas in prison who was a rebel and had committed murder during a riot.","The crowd came to Pilate and began to ask him to free a prisoner as he always did.","So Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?”","Pilate knew that the leading priests had turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous.","But the leading priests had persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas, not Jesus.","Then Pilate asked the crowd again, “So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?”","They shouted, “Crucify him!”","Pilate asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?”\nBut they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”","Pilate wanted to please the crowd, so he freed Barabbas for them. After having Jesus beaten with whips, he handed Jesus over to the soldiers to be crucified.","The soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace (called the Praetorium) and called all the other soldiers together.","They put a purple robe on Jesus and used thorny branches to make a crown for his head.","They began to call out to him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”","The soldiers beat Jesus on the head many times with a stick. They spit on him and made fun of him by bowing on their knees and worshiping him.","After they finished, the soldiers took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him out of the palace to be crucified.","A man named Simon from Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was coming from the fields to the city. The soldiers forced Simon to carry the cross for Jesus.","They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull.","The soldiers tried to give Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he refused.","The soldiers crucified Jesus and divided his clothes among themselves, throwing lots to decide what each soldier would get.","It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified Jesus.","There was a sign with this charge against Jesus written on it: the king of the jews.","They also put two robbers on crosses beside Jesus, one on the right, and the other on the left.","[And the Scripture came true that says, “They put him with criminals.”](bf)","People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads, saying, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days.","So save yourself! Come down from that cross!”","The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also making fun of Jesus. They said to each other, “He saved other people, but he can’t save himself.","If he is really the Christ, the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross. When we see this, we will believe in him.” The robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him.","At noon the whole country became dark, and the darkness lasted for three hours.","At three o’clock Jesus cried in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.” This means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”","When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He is calling Elijah.”","Someone there ran and got a sponge, filled it with vinegar, tied it to a stick, and gave it to Jesus to drink. He said, “We want to see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross.”","Then Jesus cried in a loud voice and died.","The curtain in the Temple(bg) was torn into two pieces, from the top to the bottom.","When the army officer who was standing in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died,(bh) he said, “This man really was the Son of God!”","Some women were standing at a distance from the cross, watching; among them were Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph.

(That means the day before the Sabbath day.) That evening,","Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body. Joseph, an important member of the Jewish council, was one of the people who was waiting for the kingdom of God to come.","Pilate was amazed that Jesus would have already died, so he called the army officer who had guarded Jesus and asked him if Jesus had already died.","The officer told Pilate that he was dead, so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body.","Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down from the cross, and wrapped it in the linen. He put the body in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock. Then he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb.","And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw the place where Jesus was laid."],["The day after the Sabbath day, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some sweet - smelling spices to put on Jesus’ body.","Very early on that day, the first day of the week, soon after sunrise, the women were on their way to the tomb.","They said to each other, “Who will roll away for us the stone that covers the entrance of the tomb?”","Then the women looked and saw that the stone had already been rolled away, even though it was very large.","The women entered the tomb and saw a young man wearing a white robe and sitting on the right side, and they were afraid.","But the man said, “Don’t be afraid. You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who has been crucified. He has risen from the dead; he is not here. Look, here is the place they laid him.","Now go and tell his followers and Peter, ‘Jesus is going into Galilee ahead of you, and you will see him there as he told you before.’”","The women were confused and shaking with fear, so they left the tomb and ran away. They did not tell anyone about what happened, because they were afraid.","After Jesus rose from the dead early on the first day of the week, he showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. One time in the past, he had forced seven demons out of her.","After Mary saw Jesus, she went and told his followers, who were very sad and were crying.","But Mary told them that Jesus was alive. She said that she had seen him, but the followers did not believe her.","Later, Jesus showed himself to two of his followers while they were walking in the country, but he did not look the same as before.","These followers went back to the others and told them what had happened, but again, the followers did not believe them.","Later Jesus showed himself to the eleven apostles while they were eating, and he criticized them because they had no faith. They were stubborn and refused to believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.","Jesus said to his followers, “Go everywhere in the world, and tell the Good News to everyone.","Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved, but anyone who does not believe will be punished.","And those who believe will be able to do these things as proof: They will use my name to force out demons.

The Spirit led Jesus into the desert","where the devil tempted Jesus for forty days. Jesus ate nothing during that time, and when those days were ended, he was very hungry.","The devil said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, tell this rock to become bread.”","Jesus answered, “It is written in the Scriptures: ‘A person does not live on bread alone.’”(n)","Then the devil took Jesus and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.","The devil said to Jesus, “I will give you all these kingdoms and all their power and glory. It has all been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish.","If you worship me, then it will all be yours.”","Jesus answered, “It is written in the Scriptures: ‘You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”(o)","Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, jump down.","It is written in the Scriptures:\n‘He has put his angels in charge of you\n    to watch over you.’\n(Psalm 91:11)","It is also written:\n‘They will catch you in their hands\n    so that you will not hit your foot on a rock.’”\n(Psalm 91:12)","Jesus answered, “But it also says in the Scriptures: ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’”(p)","After the devil had tempted Jesus in every way, he left him to wait until a better time.","Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit, and stories about him spread all through the area.","He began to teach in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.","Jesus traveled to Nazareth, where he had grown up. On the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue, as he always did, and stood up to read.","The book of Isaiah the prophet was given to him. He opened the book and found the place where this is written:","“The Lord has put his Spirit in me,\n    because he appointed me to tell the Good News to the poor.\nHe has sent me to tell the captives they are free\n    and to tell the blind that they can see again.\n(Isaiah 61:1)\nGod sent me to free those who have been treated unfairly\n(Isaiah 58:6)","and to announce the time when the Lord will show his kindness.”\n(Isaiah 61:2)","Jesus closed the book, gave it back to the assistant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue was watching Jesus closely.","He began to say to them, “While you heard these words just now, they were coming true!”","All the people spoke well of Jesus and were amazed at the words of grace he spoke. They asked, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”","Jesus said to them, “I know that you will tell me the old saying: ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ You want to say, ‘We heard about the things you did in Capernaum. Do those things here in your own town!’”","Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.","But I tell you the truth, there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah. It did not rain in Israel for three and one - half years, and there was no food anywhere in the whole country.","But Elijah was sent to none of those widows, only to a widow in Zarephath, a town in Sidon.","And there were many with skin diseases living in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha. But none of them were healed, only Naaman, who was from the country of Syria.”","When all the people in the synagogue heard these things, they became very angry.","They got up, forced Jesus out of town, and took him to the edge of the cliff on which the town was built. They planned to throw him off the edge,","but Jesus walked through the crowd and went on his way.","Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and on the Sabbath day, he taught the people.","They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.","In the synagogue a man who had within him an evil spirit shouted in a loud voice,","“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are - God’s Holy One!”","Jesus commanded the evil spirit, “Be quiet! Come out of the man!” The evil spirit threw the man down to the ground before all the people and then left the man without hurting him.","The people were amazed and said to each other, “What does this mean? With authority and power he commands evil spirits, and they come out.”","And so the news about Jesus spread to every place in the whole area.","Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon.(q) Simon’s mother - in - law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.","He came to her side and commanded the fever to leave. It left her, and immediately she got up and began serving them.","When the sun went down, the people brought those who were sick to Jesus. Putting his hands on each sick person, he healed every one of them.","Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God.” But Jesus commanded the demons and would not allow them to speak, because they knew Jesus was the Christ.","At daybreak, Jesus went to a lonely place, but the people looked for him. When they found him, they tried to keep him from leaving.","But Jesus said to them, “I must preach about God’s kingdom to other towns, too. This is why I was sent.”","Then he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.(r)"],["One day while Jesus was standing beside Lake Galilee, many people were pressing all around him to hear the word of God.","Jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.","Jesus got into one of the boats, the one that belonged to Simon,(s) and asked him to push off a little from the land. Then Jesus sat down and continued to teach the people from the boat.","When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Take the boat into deep water, and put your nets in the water to catch some fish.”","Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night trying to catch fish, and we caught nothing. But you say to put the nets in the water, so I will.”","When the fishermen did as Jesus told them, they caught so many fish that the nets began to break.","They called to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they were almost sinking.","When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he bowed down before Jesus and said, “Go away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man!”","He and the other fishermen were amazed at the many fish they caught, as were","James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.\nJesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will fish for people.”","When the men brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.","When Jesus was in one of the towns, there was a man covered with a skin disease. When he saw Jesus, he bowed before him and begged him, “Lord, you can heal me if you will.”","Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said, “I will. Be healed!” Immediately the disease disappeared.","Then Jesus said, “Don’t tell anyone about this, but go and show yourself to the priest(t) and offer a gift for your healing, as Moses commanded.(u) This will show the people what I have done.”","But the news about Jesus spread even more. Many people came to hear Jesus and to be healed of their sicknesses,","but Jesus often slipped away to be alone so he could pray.","One day as Jesus was teaching the people, the Pharisees and teachers of the law from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem were there. The Lord was giving Jesus the power to heal people.","Just then, some men were carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and put him down before Jesus.","But because there were so many people there, they could not find a way in. So they went up on the roof and lowered the man on his mat through the ceiling into the middle of the crowd right before Jesus.","Seeing their faith, Jesus said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”","The Jewish teachers of the law and the Pharisees thought to themselves, “Who is this man who is speaking as if he were God? Only God can forgive sins.”","But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why are you thinking these things?","Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?","But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, stand up, take your mat, and go home.”","At once the man stood up before them, picked up his mat, and went home, praising God.","All the people were fully amazed and began to praise God. They were filled with much respect and said, “Today we have seen amazing things!”","After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax collector’s booth. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”","So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.","Then Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus at his house. Many tax collectors and other people were eating there, too.","But the Pharisees and the men who taught the law for the Pharisees began to complain to Jesus’ followers, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”","Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy people who need a doctor, but the sick.","I have not come to invite good people but sinners to change their hearts and lives.”","They said to Jesus, “John’s followers often fast(v) for a certain time and pray, just as the Pharisees do. But your followers eat and drink all the time.”","Jesus said to them, “You cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them.","But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.”","Jesus told them this story: “No one takes cloth off a new coat to cover a hole in an old coat. Otherwise, he ruins the new coat, and the cloth from the new coat will not be the same as the old cloth.","Also, no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags. Otherwise, the new wine will break the bags, the wine will spill out, and the leather bags will be ruined.","New wine must be put into new leather bags.","No one after drinking old wine wants new wine, because he says, ‘The old wine is better.’”"],["One Sabbath day Jesus was walking through some fields of grain. His followers picked the heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.","Some Pharisees said, “Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”","Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?","He went into God’s house and took and ate the holy bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he gave some to the people who were with him.”","Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.”","On another Sabbath day Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man with a crippled right hand was there.","The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching closely to see if Jesus would heal on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him.","But he knew what they were thinking, and he said to the man with the crippled hand, “Stand up here in the middle of everyone.” The man got up and stood there.","Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?”","Jesus looked around at all of them and said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it was healed.","But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were very angry and discussed with each other what they could do to Jesus.","At that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray, and he spent the night praying to God.","The next morning, Jesus called his followers to him and chose twelve of them, whom he named apostles:","Simon (Jesus named him Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,","Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon (called the Zealot),","Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot who later turned Jesus over to his enemies.","Jesus and the apostles came down from the mountain, and he stood on level ground. A large group of his followers was there, as well as many people from all around Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast cities of Tyre and Sidon.","They all came to hear Jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses, and he healed those who were troubled by evil spirits.","All the people were trying to touch Jesus, because power was coming from him and healing them all.","Jesus looked at his followers and said,\n“You people who are poor are blessed,\n    because the kingdom of God belongs to you.","You people who are now hungry are blessed,\n    because you will be satisfied.\nYou people who are now crying are blessed,\n    because you will laugh with joy.","“People will hate you, shut you out, insult you, and say you are evil because you follow the Son of Man. But when they do, you will be blessed.","Be full of joy at that time, because you have a great reward in heaven. Their ancestors did the same things to the prophets.","“But how terrible it will be for you who are rich,\n    because you have had your easy life.","How terrible it will be for you who are full now,\n    because you will be hungry.\nHow terrible it will be for you who are laughing now,\n    because you will be sad and cry.","“How terrible when everyone says only good things about you, because their ancestors said the same things about the false prophets.","“But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you,","bless those who curse you, pray for those who are cruel to you.","If anyone slaps you on one cheek, offer him the other cheek, too. If someone takes your coat, do not stop him from taking your shirt.","Give to everyone who asks you, and when someone takes something that is yours, don’t ask for it back.","Do to others what you would want them to do to you.","If you love only the people who love you, what praise should you get? Even sinners love the people who love them.","If you do good only to those who do good to you, what praise should you get? Even sinners do that!","If you lend things to people, always hoping to get something back, what praise should you get? Even sinners lend to other sinners so that they can get back the same amount!","But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without hoping to get anything back. Then you will have a great reward, and you will be children of the Most High God, because he is kind even to people who are ungrateful and full of sin.","Show mercy, just as your Father shows mercy.","“Don’t judge others, and you will not be judged. Don’t accuse others of being guilty, and you will not be accused of being guilty. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.","Give, and you will receive. You will be given much. Pressed down, shaken together, and running over, it will spill into your lap. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you.”","Jesus told them this story: “Can a blind person lead another blind person? No! Both of them will fall into a ditch.","A student is not better than the teacher, but the student who has been fully trained will be like the teacher.","“Why do you notice the little piece of dust in your friend’s eye, but you don’t notice the big piece of wood in your own eye?","How can you say to your friend, ‘Friend, let me take that little piece of dust out of your eye’ when you cannot see that big piece of wood in your own eye! You hypocrite! First, take the wood out of your own eye. Then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your friend’s eye.","“A good tree does not produce bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.","Each tree is known by its own fruit. People don’t gather figs from thornbushes, and they don’t get grapes from bushes.","Good people bring good things out of the good they stored in their hearts. But evil people bring evil things out of the evil they stored in their hearts. People speak the things that are in their hearts.","“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ but do not do what I say?","I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me and hears my words and obeys.","That person is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the floods came, the water tried to wash the house away, but it could not shake it, because the house was built well.","But the one who hears my words and does not obey is like a man who built his house on the ground without a foundation. When the floods came, the house quickly fell and was completely destroyed.”"],["When Jesus finished saying all these things to the people, he went to Capernaum.","There was an army officer who had a servant who was very important to him. The servant was so sick he was nearly dead.","When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant.","The men went to Jesus and begged him, saying, “This officer is worthy of your help.","He loves our people, and he built us a synagogue.”","So Jesus went with the men. He was getting near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, because I am not worthy to have you come into my house.","That is why I did not come to you myself. But you only need to command it, and my servant will be healed.","I, too, am a man under the authority of others, and I have soldiers under my command. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant does it.”","When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, this is the greatest faith I have found anywhere, even in Israel.”","Those who had been sent to Jesus went back to the house where they found the servant in good health.","Soon afterwards Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his followers and a large crowd traveled with him.","When he came near the town gate, he saw a funeral. A mother, who was a widow, had lost her only son. A large crowd from the town was with the mother while her son was being carried out.","When the Lord saw her, he felt very sorry for her and said, “Don’t cry.”","He went up and touched the coffin, and the people who were carrying it stopped. Jesus said, “Young man, I tell you, get up!”","And the son sat up and began to talk. Then Jesus gave him back to his mother.","All the people were amazed and began praising God, saying, “A great prophet has come to us! God has come to help his people.”","This news about Jesus spread through all Judea and into all the places around there.","John’s followers told him about all these things. He called for two of his followers","and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?”","When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you with this question: ‘Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?’”","At that time, Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses, diseases, and evil spirits, and he gave sight to many blind people.","Then Jesus answered John’s followers, “Go tell John what you saw and heard here. The blind can see, the crippled can walk, and people with skin diseases are healed. The deaf can hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is preached to the poor.","Those who do not stumble in their faith because of me are blessed!”","When John’s followers left, Jesus began talking to the people about John: “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed(w) blown by the wind?","What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, people who have fine clothes and much wealth live in kings’ palaces.","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, and I tell you, John is more than a prophet.","This was written about him:\n‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare the way for you.’\n(Malachi 3:1)","I tell you, John is greater than any other person ever born, but even the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John.”","(When the people, including the tax collectors, heard this, they all agreed that God’s teaching was good, because they had been baptized by John.","But the Pharisees and experts on the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves; they did not let John baptize them.)","Then Jesus said, “What shall I say about the people of this time? What are they like?","They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling to one another and saying,\n‘We played music for you, but you did not dance;\n    we sang a sad song, but you did not cry.’","John the Baptist came and did not eat bread or drink wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon in him.’","The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine, and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’","But wisdom is proved to be right by what it does.”","One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, so Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table.","A sinful woman in the town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So she brought an alabaster jar of perfume","and stood behind Jesus at his feet, crying. She began to wash his feet with her tears, and she dried them with her hair, kissing them many times and rubbing them with the perfume.","When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this, he thought to himself, “If Jesus were a prophet, he would know that the woman touching him is a sinner!”","Jesus said to the Pharisee, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”\nSimon said, “Teacher, tell me.”","Jesus said, “Two people owed money to the same banker. One owed five hundred coins(x) and the other owed fifty.","They had no money to pay what they owed, but the banker told both of them they did not have to pay him. Which person will love the banker more?”","Simon, the Pharisee, answered, “I think it would be the one who owed him the most money.”\nJesus said to Simon, “You are right.”","Then Jesus turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I came into your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.","You gave me no kiss of greeting, but she has been kissing my feet since I came in.","You did not put oil on my head, but she poured perfume on my feet.","I tell you that her many sins are forgiven, so she showed great love. But the person who is forgiven only a little will love only a little.”","Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”","The people sitting at the table began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”","Jesus said to the woman, “Because you believed, you are saved from your sins. Go in peace.”"],["After this, while Jesus was traveling through some cities and small towns, he preached and told the Good News about God’s kingdom. The twelve apostles were with him,","and also some women who had been healed of sicknesses and evil spirits: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;","Joanna, the wife of Cuza (the manager of Herod’s house); Susanna; and many others. These women used their own money to help Jesus and his apostles.","When a great crowd was gathered, and people were coming to Jesus from every town, he told them this story:","“A farmer went out to plant his seed. While he was planting, some seed fell by the road. People walked on the seed, and the birds ate it up.","Some seed fell on rock, and when it began to grow, it died because it had no water.","Some seed fell among thorny weeds, but the weeds grew up with it and choked the good plants.","And some seed fell on good ground and grew and made a hundred times more.”\nAs Jesus finished the story, he called out, “Let those with ears use them and listen!”","Jesus’ followers asked him what this story meant.","Jesus said, “You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of God. But I use stories to speak to other people so that:\n‘They will look, but they may not see.\n    They will listen, but they may not understand.’\n(Isaiah 6:9)","“This is what the story means: The seed is God’s message.","The seed that fell beside the road is like the people who hear God’s teaching, but the devil comes and takes it away from them so they cannot believe it and be saved.","The seed that fell on rock is like those who hear God’s teaching and accept it gladly, but they don’t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives. They believe for a while, but when trouble comes, they give up.","The seed that fell among the thorny weeds is like those who hear God’s teaching, but they let the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life keep them from growing and producing good fruit.","And the seed that fell on the good ground is like those who hear God’s teaching with good, honest hearts and obey it and patiently produce good fruit.","“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. Instead, the person puts it on a lampstand so those who come in will see the light.","Everything that is hidden will become clear, and every secret thing will be made known.","So be careful how you listen. Those who have understanding will be given more. But those who do not have understanding, even what they think they have will be taken away from them.”","Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but there was such a crowd they could not get to him.","Someone said to Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”","Jesus answered them, “My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and obey it!”","One day Jesus and his followers got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let’s go across the lake.” And so they started across.","While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A very strong wind blew up on the lake, causing the boat to fill with water, and they were in danger.","The followers went to Jesus and woke him, saying, “Master! Master! We will drown!”\nJesus got up and gave a command to the wind and the waves. They stopped, and it became calm.","Jesus said to his followers, “Where is your faith?”\nThe followers were afraid and amazed and said to each other, “Who is this that commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him?”","Jesus and his followers sailed across the lake from Galilee to the area of the Gerasene(y) people.","When Jesus got out on the land, a man from the town who had demons inside him came to Jesus. For a long time he had worn no clothes and had lived in the burial caves, not in a house.","When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him. He said with a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!”","He said this because Jesus was commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had taken hold of him. Though he had been kept under guard and chained hand and foot, he had broken his chains and had been forced by the demon out into a lonely place.","Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\nHe answered, “Legion,”(z) because many demons were in him.","The demons begged Jesus not to send them into eternal darkness.(aa)","A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill, and the demons begged Jesus to allow them to go into the pigs. So Jesus allowed them to do this.","When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd ran down the hill into the lake and was drowned.","When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told about this in the town and the countryside.","And people went to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, because the demons were gone. But the people were frightened.","The people who saw this happen told the others how Jesus had made the man well.","All the people of the Gerasene country asked Jesus to leave, because they were all very afraid. So Jesus got into the boat and went back to Galilee.","The man whom Jesus had healed begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,","“Go back home and tell people how much God has done for you.” So the man went all over town telling how much Jesus had done for him.","When Jesus got back to Galilee, a crowd welcomed him, because everyone was waiting for him.","A man named Jairus, a leader of the synagogue, came to Jesus and fell at his feet, begging him to come to his house.","Jairus’ only daughter, about twelve years old, was dying.\nWhile Jesus was on his way to Jairus’ house, the people were crowding all around him.","A woman was in the crowd who had been bleeding for twelve years,(ab) but no one was able to heal her.","She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat, and instantly her bleeding stopped.","Then Jesus said, “Who touched me?”\nWhen all the people said they had not touched him, Peter said, “Master, the people are all around you and are pushing against you.”","But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, because I felt power go out from me.”","When the woman saw she could not hide, she came forward, shaking, and fell down before Jesus. While all the people listened, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.","Jesus said to her, “Dear woman, you are made well because you believed. Go in peace.”","While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”","When Jesus heard this, he said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid. Just believe, and your daughter will be well.”","When Jesus went to the house, he let only Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother go inside with him.","All the people were crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead, but Jesus said, “Stop crying. She is not dead, only asleep.”","The people laughed at Jesus because they knew the girl was dead.","But Jesus took hold of her hand and called to her, “My child, stand up!”","Her spirit came back into her, and she stood up at once. Then Jesus ordered that she be given something to eat.","The girl’s parents were amazed, but Jesus told them not to tell anyone what had happened."],["Jesus called the twelve apostles together and gave them power and authority over all demons and the ability to heal sicknesses.","He sent the apostles out to tell about God’s kingdom and to heal the sick.","He said to them, “Take nothing for your trip, neither a walking stick, bag, bread, money, or extra clothes.","When you enter a house, stay there until it is time to leave.","If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off of your feet(ac) as you leave the town, as a warning to them.”","So the apostles went out and traveled through all the towns, preaching the Good News and healing people everywhere.","Herod, the governor, heard about all the things that were happening and was confused, because some people said, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead.”","Others said, “Elijah has come to us.” And still others said, “One of the prophets who lived long ago has risen from the dead.”","Herod said, “I cut off John’s head, so who is this man I hear such things about?” And Herod kept trying to see Jesus.","When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then Jesus took them with him to a town called Bethsaida where they could be alone together.","But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him. He welcomed them and talked with them about God’s kingdom and healed those who needed to be healed.","Late in the afternoon, the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said, “Send the people away. They need to go to the towns and countryside around here and find places to sleep and something to eat, because no one lives in this place.”","But Jesus said to them, “You give them something to eat.”\nThey said, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go buy food for all these people.”","(There were about five thousand men there.)\nJesus said to his followers, “Tell the people to sit in groups of about fifty people.”","So the followers did this, and all the people sat down.","Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he thanked God for the food. Then he divided the food and gave it to the followers to give to the people.","They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was gathered up, filling twelve baskets.","One time when Jesus was praying alone, his followers were with him, and he asked them, “Who do the people say I am?”","They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others say you are Elijah.(ad) And others say you are one of the prophets from long ago who has come back to life.”","Then Jesus asked, “But who do you say I am?”\nPeter answered, “You are the Christ from God.”","Jesus warned them not to tell anyone, saying,","“The Son of Man must suffer many things. He will be rejected by the Jewish elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law. He will be killed and after three days will be raised from the dead.”","Jesus said to all of them, “If people want to follow me, they must give up the things they want. They must be willing to give up their lives daily to follow me.","Those who want to save their lives will give up true life. But those who give up their lives for me will have true life.","It is worthless to have the whole world if they themselves are destroyed or lost.","If people are ashamed of me and my teaching, then the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and with the glory of the Father and the holy angels.","I tell you the truth, some people standing here will see the kingdom of God before they die.”","About eight days after Jesus said these things, he took Peter, John, and James and went up on a mountain to pray.","While Jesus was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became shining white.","Then two men, Moses and Elijah,(ae) were talking with Jesus.","They appeared in heavenly glory, talking about his departure which he would soon bring about in Jerusalem.","Peter and the others were very sleepy, but when they awoke fully, they saw the glory of Jesus and the two men standing with him.","When Moses and Elijah were about to leave, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (Peter did not know what he was talking about.)","While he was saying these things, a cloud came and covered them, and they became afraid as the cloud covered them.","A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to him!”","When the voice finished speaking, only Jesus was there. Peter, John, and James said nothing and told no one at that time what they had seen.","The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus.","A man in the crowd shouted to him, “Teacher, please come and look at my son, because he is my only child.","An evil spirit seizes my son, and suddenly he screams. It causes him to lose control of himself and foam at the mouth. The evil spirit keeps on hurting him and almost never leaves him.","I begged your followers to force the evil spirit out, but they could not do it.”","Jesus answered, “You people have no faith, and your lives are all wrong. How long must I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”","While the boy was coming, the demon threw him on the ground and made him lose control of himself. But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.","All the people were amazed at the great power of God.\nJesus Talks About His Death\nWhile everyone was wondering about all that Jesus did, he said to his followers,","“Don’t forget what I tell you now: The Son of Man will be handed over to people.”","But the followers did not understand what this meant; the meaning was hidden from them so they could not understand. But they were afraid to ask Jesus about it.\nWho Is the Greatest?","Jesus’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest.","Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he took a little child and stood the child beside him.","Then Jesus said, “Whoever accepts this little child in my name accepts me. And whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me, because whoever is least among you all is really the greatest.”","John answered, “Master, we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people. We told him to stop, because he does not belong to our group.”","But Jesus said to him, “Don’t stop him, because whoever is not against you is for you.”","When the time was coming near for Jesus to depart, he was determined to go to Jerusalem.","He sent some messengers ahead of him, who went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him.","But the people there would not welcome him, because he was set on going to Jerusalem.","When James and John, followers of Jesus, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people?”(af)","But Jesus turned and scolded them. [And Jesus said, “You don’t know what kind of spirit you belong to.","The Son of Man did not come to destroy the souls of people but to save them.”](ag) Then they went to another town.","As they were going along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow you any place you go.”","Jesus said to them, “The foxes have holes to live in, and the birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head.”","Jesus said to another man, “Follow me!”\nBut he said, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”","But Jesus said to him, “Let the people who are dead bury their own dead. You must go and tell about the kingdom of God.”","Another man said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me go and say good - bye to my family.”","Jesus said, “Anyone who begins to plow a field but keeps looking back is of no use in the kingdom of God.”"],["After this, the Lord chose seventy - two(ah) others and sent them out in pairs ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go.","He said to them, “There are a great many people to harvest, but there are only a few workers. So pray to God, who owns the harvest, that he will send more workers to help gather his harvest.","Go now, but listen! I am sending you out like sheep among wolves.","Don’t carry a purse, a bag, or sandals, and don’t waste time talking with people on the road.","Before you go into a house, say, ‘Peace be with this house.’","If peace - loving people live there, your blessing of peace will stay with them, but if not, then your blessing will come back to you.","Stay in the same house, eating and drinking what the people there give you. A worker should be given his pay.

How terrible for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles I did in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon,(ak) those people would have changed their lives long ago. They would have worn rough cloth and put ashes on themselves to show they had changed.","But on the Judgment Day it will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you, Capernaum,(al) will you be lifted up to heaven? No! You will be thrown down to the depths!","“Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever refuses to accept you refuses to accept me. And whoever refuses to accept me refuses to accept the One who sent me.”","When the seventy - two(am) came back, they were very happy and said, “Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we used your name!”","Jesus said, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.","Listen, I have given you power to walk on snakes and scorpions, power that is greater than the enemy has. So nothing will hurt you.","But you should not be happy because the spirits obey you but because your names are written in heaven.”","Then Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the people who are wise and smart. But you have shown them to those who are like little children. Yes, Father, this is what you really wanted.","“My Father has given me all things. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father. And no one knows who the Father is, except the Son and those whom the Son chooses to tell.”","Then Jesus turned to his followers and said privately, “You are blessed to see what you now see.","I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see, but they did not, and they wanted to hear what you now hear, but they did not.”","Then an expert on the law stood up to test Jesus, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to get life forever?”","Jesus said, “What is written in the law? What do you read there?”","The man answered, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.”(an) Also, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”(ao)","Jesus said to him, “Your answer is right. Do this and you will live.”","But the man, wanting to show the importance of his question, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”","Jesus answered, “As a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, some robbers attacked him. They tore off his clothes, beat him, and left him lying there, almost dead.","It happened that a priest was going down that road. When he saw the man, he walked by on the other side.","Next, a Levite(ap) came there, and after he went over and looked at the man, he walked by on the other side of the road.","Then a Samaritan(aq) traveling down the road came to where the hurt man was. When he saw the man, he felt very sorry for him.","The Samaritan went to him, poured olive oil and wine(ar) on his wounds, and bandaged them. Then he put the hurt man on his own donkey and took him to an inn where he cared for him.","The next day, the Samaritan brought out two coins,(as) gave them to the innkeeper, and said, ‘Take care of this man. If you spend more money on him, I will pay it back to you when I come again.’”","Then Jesus said, “Which one of these three men do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by the robbers?”","The expert on the law answered, “The one who showed him mercy.”\nJesus said to him, “Then go and do what he did.”","While Jesus and his followers were traveling, Jesus went into a town. A woman named Martha let Jesus stay at her house.","Martha had a sister named Mary, who was sitting at Jesus’ feet and listening to him teach.","But Martha was busy with all the work to be done.

Mary has chosen the better thing, and it will never be taken away from her.”"],["One time Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his followers said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his followers.”","Jesus said to them, “When you pray, say:\n‘Father, may your name always be kept holy.\nMay your kingdom come.","Give us the food we need for each day.","Forgive us for our sins,\n    because we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us.\nAnd do not cause us to be tempted.’”(at)","Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you went to your friend’s house at midnight and said to him, ‘Friend, loan me three loaves of bread.","A friend of mine has come into town to visit me, but I have nothing for him to eat.’","Your friend inside the house answers, ‘Don’t bother me! The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’","I tell you, if friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread, your boldness will make him get up and give you whatever you need.","So I tell you, ask, and God will give to you.

When the demon came out, the man who had been unable to speak, then spoke. The people were amazed.","But some of them said, “Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, to force demons out of people.”","Other people, wanting to test Jesus, asked him to give them a sign from heaven.","But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed.

So the person has even more trouble than before.”","As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out to Jesus, “Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and nursed you.”","But Jesus said, “No, blessed are those who hear the teaching of God and obey it.”","As the crowd grew larger, Jesus said, “The people who live today are evil.

Then the master became angry and said, ‘Go at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’","Later the servant said to him, ‘Master, I did what you commanded, but we still have room.’","The master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes, and urge the people there to come so my house will be full.","I tell you, none of those whom I invited first will eat with me.’”","Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned and said to them,","“If anyone comes to me but loves his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, or sisters - or even life - more than me, he cannot be my follower.","Whoever is not willing to carry his cross and follow me cannot be my follower.","If you want to build a tower, you first sit down and decide how much it will cost, to see if you have enough money to finish the job.","If you don’t, you might lay the foundation, but you would not be able to finish. Then all who would see it would make fun of you,","saying, ‘This person began to build but was not able to finish.’","“If a king is going to fight another king, first he will sit down and plan. He will decide if he and his ten thousand soldiers can defeat the other king who has twenty thousand soldiers.","If he can’t, then while the other king is still far away, he will send some people to speak to him and ask for peace.","In the same way, you must give up everything you have to be my follower.","“Salt is good, but if it loses its salty taste, you cannot make it salty again.","It is no good for the soil or for manure; it is thrown away.\n“Let those with ears use them and listen.”"],["The tax collectors and sinners all came to listen to Jesus.","But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain: “Look, this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them.”","Then Jesus told them this story:","“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep but loses one of them. Then he will leave the other ninety - nine sheep in the open field and go out and look for the lost sheep until he finds it.","And when he finds it, he happily puts it on his shoulders","and goes home. He calls to his friends and neighbors and says, ‘Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep.’","In the same way, I tell you there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes his heart and life, than over ninety - nine good people who don’t need to change.","“Suppose a woman has ten silver coins,(be) but loses one. She will light a lamp, sweep the house, and look carefully for the coin until she finds it.","And when she finds it, she will call her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Be happy with me because I have found the coin that I lost.’","In the same way, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when one sinner changes his heart and life.”","Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons.","The younger son said to his father, ‘Give me my share of the property.’ So the father divided the property between his two sons.","Then the younger son gathered up all that was his and traveled far away to another country. There he wasted his money in foolish living.","After he had spent everything, a time came when there was no food anywhere in the country, and the son was poor and hungry.","So he got a job with one of the citizens there who sent the son into the fields to feed pigs.","The son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.","When he realized what he was doing, he thought, ‘All of my father’s servants have plenty of food. But I am here, almost dying with hunger.","I will leave and return to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against God and against you.","I am no longer worthy to be called your son, but let me be like one of your servants.”’","So the son left and went to his father.\n“While the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt sorry for his son. So the father ran to him and hugged and kissed him.","The son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’(bf)","But the father said to his servants, ‘Hurry! Bring the best clothes and put them on him. Also, put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.","And get our fat calf and kill it so we can have a feast and celebrate.","My son was dead, but now he is alive again! He was lost, but now he is found!’ So they began to celebrate.","“The older son was in the field, and as he came closer to the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing.","So he called to one of the servants and asked what all this meant.","The servant said, ‘Your brother has come back, and your father killed the fat calf, because your brother came home safely.’","The older son was angry and would not go in to the feast. So his father went out and begged him to come in.","But the older son said to his father, ‘I have served you like a slave for many years and have always obeyed your commands. But you never gave me even a young goat to have at a feast with my friends.","But your other son, who wasted all your money on prostitutes, comes home, and you kill the fat calf for him!’","The father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.","We had to celebrate and be happy because your brother was dead, but now he is alive. He was lost, but now he is found.’”"],["Jesus also said to his followers, “Once there was a rich man who had a manager to take care of his business. This manager was accused of cheating him.","So he called the manager in and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give me a report of what you have done with my money, because you can’t be my manager any longer.’","The manager thought to himself, ‘What will I do since my master is taking my job away from me? I am not strong enough to dig ditches, and I am ashamed to beg.","I know what I’ll do so that when I lose my job people will welcome me into their homes.’","“So the manager called in everyone who owed the master any money. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe?’","He answered, ‘Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write four hundred gallons.’","Then the manager asked another one, ‘How much do you owe?’ He answered, ‘One thousand bushels of wheat.’ Then the manager said to him, ‘Take your bill and write eight hundred bushels.’","So, the master praised the dishonest manager for being clever. Yes, worldly people are more clever with their own kind than spiritual people are.","“I tell you, make friends for yourselves using worldly riches so that when those riches are gone, you will be welcomed in those homes that continue forever.","Whoever can be trusted with a little can also be trusted with a lot, and whoever is dishonest with a little is dishonest with a lot.","If you cannot be trusted with worldly riches, then who will trust you with true riches?","And if you cannot be trusted with things that belong to someone else, who will give you things of your own?","“No servant can serve two masters. The servant will hate one master and love the other, or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other. You cannot serve both God and worldly riches.”","The Pharisees, who loved money, were listening to all these things and made fun of Jesus.","He said to them, “You make yourselves look good in front of people, but God knows what is really in your hearts. What is important to people is hateful in God’s sight.","“The law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were preached until John(bg) came. Since then the Good News about the kingdom of God is being told, and everyone tries to enter it by force.","It would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter in the law to be changed.","“If a man divorces his wife and marries another woman, he is guilty of adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman is also guilty of adultery.”","Jesus said, “There was a rich man who always dressed in the finest clothes and lived in luxury every day.","And a very poor man named Lazarus, whose body was covered with sores, was laid at the rich man’s gate.","He wanted to eat only the small pieces of food that fell from the rich man’s table. And the dogs would come and lick his sores.","Later, Lazarus died, and the angels carried him to the arms of Abraham. The rich man died, too, and was buried.","In the place of the dead, he was in much pain. The rich man saw Abraham far away with Lazarus at his side.","He called, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am suffering in this fire!’","But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember when you were alive you had the good things in life, but bad things happened to Lazarus. Now he is comforted here, and you are suffering.","Besides, there is a big pit between you and us, so no one can cross over to you, and no one can leave there and come here.’","The rich man said, ‘Father, then please send Lazarus to my father’s house.","I have five brothers, and Lazarus could warn them so that they will not come to this place of pain.’","But Abraham said, ‘They have the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets; let them learn from them.’","The rich man said, ‘No, father Abraham! If someone goes to them from the dead, they would believe and change their hearts and lives.’","But Abraham said to him, ‘If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not listen to someone who comes back from the dead.’”"],["Jesus said to his followers, “Things that cause people to sin will happen, but how terrible for the person who causes them to happen!","It would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large stone around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to sin.","So be careful!\n“If another follower sins, warn him, and if he is sorry and stops sinning, forgive him.","If he sins against you seven times in one day and says that he is sorry each time, forgive him.”","The apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith!”","The Lord said, “If your faith were the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Dig yourself up and plant yourself in the sea,’ and it would obey you.","“Suppose one of you has a servant who has been plowing the ground or caring for the sheep. When the servant comes in from working in the field, would you say, ‘Come in and sit down to eat’?","No, you would say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat. Then get yourself ready and serve me. After I finish eating and drinking, you can eat.’","The servant does not get any special thanks for doing what his master commanded.","It is the same with you. When you have done everything you are told to do, you should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done the work we should do.’”","While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he was going through the area between Samaria and Galilee.","As he came into a small town, ten men who had a skin disease met him there. They did not come close to Jesus","but called to him, “Jesus! Master! Have mercy on us!”","When Jesus saw the men, he said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.”(bh)\nAs the ten men were going, they were healed.","When one of them saw that he was healed, he went back to Jesus, praising God in a loud voice.","Then he bowed down at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (And this man was a Samaritan.)","Jesus said, “Weren’t ten men healed? Where are the other nine?","Is this Samaritan the only one who came back to thank God?”","Then Jesus said to him, “Stand up and go on your way. You were healed because you believed.”","Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus, “When will the kingdom of God come?”\nJesus answered, “God’s kingdom is coming, but not in a way that you will be able to see with your eyes.","People will not say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or, ‘There it is!’ because God’s kingdom is within(bi) you.”","Then Jesus said to his followers, “The time will come when you will want very much to see one of the days of the Son of Man. But you will not see it.","People will say to you, ‘Look, there he is!’ or, ‘Look, here he is!’ Stay where you are; don’t go away and search.","“When the Son of Man comes again, he will shine like lightning, which flashes across the sky and lights it up from one side to the other.","But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by the people of this time.","When the Son of Man comes again, it will be as it was when Noah lived.","People were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving their children to be married until the day Noah entered the boat. Then the flood came and killed them all.","It will be the same as during the time of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building.","But the day Lot left Sodom,(bj) fire and sulfur rained down from the sky and killed them all.","This is how it will be when the Son of Man comes again.","“On that day, a person who is on the roof and whose belongings are in the house should not go inside to get them. A person who is in the field should not go back home.","Remember Lot’s wife.(bk)","Those who try to keep their lives will lose them. But those who give up their lives will save them.","I tell you, on that night two people will be sleeping in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.","There will be two women grinding grain together; one will be taken, and the other will be left. [","Two people will be in the field. One will be taken, and the other will be left.]”(bl)","The followers asked Jesus, “Where will this be, Lord?”\nJesus answered, “Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”"],["Then Jesus used this story to teach his followers that they should always pray and never lose hope.","“In a certain town there was a judge who did not respect God or care about people.","In that same town there was a widow who kept coming to this judge, saying, ‘Give me my rights against my enemy.’","For a while the judge refused to help her. But afterwards, he thought to himself, ‘Even though I don’t respect God or care about people,","I will see that she gets her rights. Otherwise she will continue to bother me until I am worn out.’”","The Lord said, “Listen to what the unfair judge said.","God will always give what is right to his people who cry to him night and day, and he will not be slow to answer them.","I tell you, God will help his people quickly. But when the Son of Man comes again, will he find those on earth who believe in him?”","Jesus told this story to some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else:","“A Pharisee and a tax collector both went to the Temple to pray.","The Pharisee stood alone and prayed, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people who steal, cheat, or take part in adultery, or even like this tax collector.","I fast(bm) twice a week, and I give one - tenth of everything I get!’","“The tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even look up to heaven. But he beat on his chest because he was so sad. He said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’","I tell you, when this man went home, he was right with God, but the Pharisee was not. All who make themselves great will be made humble, but all who make themselves humble will be made great.”\nWho Will Enter God’s Kingdom?","Some people brought even their babies to Jesus so he could touch them. When the followers saw this, they told them to stop.","But Jesus called for the children, saying, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children.","I tell you the truth, you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a child, or you will never enter it.”","A certain leader asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to have life forever?”","Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? Only God is good.","You know the commands: ‘You must not be guilty of adultery. You must not murder anyone. You must not steal. You must not tell lies about your neighbor. Honor your father and mother.’”(bn)","But the leader said, “I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy.”","When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “There is still one more thing you need to do. Sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.”","But when the man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich.","Jesus looked at him and said, “It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God.","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”\nWho Can Be Saved?","When the people heard this, they asked, “Then who can be saved?”","Jesus answered, “The things impossible for people are possible for God.”","Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”","Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, all those who have left houses, wives, brothers, parents, or children for the kingdom of God","will get much more in this life. And in the age that is coming, they will have life forever.”","Then Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said to them, “We are going to Jerusalem. Everything the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen.","He will be turned over to those who are evil. They will laugh at him, insult him, spit on him,","beat him with whips, and kill him. But on the third day, he will rise to life again.”","The apostles did not understand this; the meaning was hidden from them, and they did not realize what was said.","As Jesus came near the city of Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging.","When he heard the people coming down the road, he asked, “What is happening?”","They told him, “Jesus, from Nazareth, is going by.”","The blind man cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”","The people leading the group warned the blind man to be quiet. But the blind man shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”","Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,","“What do you want me to do for you?”\nHe said, “Lord, I want to see.”","Jesus said to him, “Then see. You are healed because you believed.”","At once the man was able to see, and he followed Jesus, thanking God. All the people who saw this praised God."],["Jesus was going through the city of Jericho.","A man was there named Zacchaeus, who was a very important tax collector, and he was wealthy.","He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he was not able because he was too short to see above the crowd.","He ran ahead to a place where Jesus would come, and he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him.","When Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.”","Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him gladly.","All the people saw this and began to complain, “Jesus is staying with a sinner!”","But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “I will give half of my possessions to the poor.

He said, ‘Do business with this money until I get back.’","But the people in the kingdom hated the man. So they sent a group to follow him and say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’","“But the man became king. When he returned home, he said, ‘Call those servants who have my money so I can know how much they earned with it.’","“The first servant came and said, ‘Sir, I earned ten coins with the one you gave me.’","The king said to the servant, ‘Excellent! You are a good servant. Since I can trust you with small things, I will let you rule over ten of my cities.’","“The second servant said, ‘Sir, I earned five coins with your one.’","The king said to this servant, ‘You can rule over five cities.’","“Then another servant came in and said to the king, ‘Sir, here is your coin which I wrapped in a piece of cloth and hid.","I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You even take money that you didn’t earn and gather food that you didn’t plant.’","Then the king said to the servant, ‘I will condemn you by your own words, you evil servant. You knew that I am a hard man, taking money that I didn’t earn and gathering food that I didn’t plant.","Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank? Then when I came back, my money would have earned some interest.’","“The king said to the men who were standing by, ‘Take the coin away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten coins.’","They said, ‘But sir, that servant already has ten coins.’","The king said, ‘Those who have will be given more, but those who do not have anything will have everything taken away from them.","Now where are my enemies who didn’t want me to be king? Bring them here and kill them before me.’”","After Jesus said this, he went on toward Jerusalem.","As Jesus came near Bethphage and Bethany, towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent out two of his followers.","He said, “Go to the town you can see there. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here to me.","If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say that the Master needs it.”","The two followers went into town and found the colt just as Jesus had told them.","As they were untying it, its owners came out and asked the followers, “Why are you untying our colt?”","The followers answered, “The Master needs it.”","So they brought it to Jesus, threw their coats on the colt’s back, and put Jesus on it.","As Jesus rode toward Jerusalem, others spread their coats on the road before him.","As he was coming close to Jerusalem, on the way down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of followers began joyfully shouting praise to God for all the miracles they had seen.","They said,\n“God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord!\n(Psalm 118:26)\nThere is peace in heaven and glory to God!”","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your followers not to say these things.”","But Jesus answered, “I tell you, if my followers didn’t say these things, then the stones would cry out.”","As Jesus came near Jerusalem, he saw the city and cried for it,","saying, “I wish you knew today what would bring you peace. But now it is hidden from you.","The time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and will hold you in on all sides.","They will destroy you and all your people, and not one stone will be left on another. All this will happen because you did not recognize the time when God came to save you.”","Jesus went into the Temple and began to throw out the people who were selling things there.","He said, “It is written in the Scriptures, ‘My Temple will be a house for prayer.’(bp) But you have changed it into a ‘hideout for robbers’!”(bq)","Jesus taught in the Temple every day.

And being amazed at his answer, they became silent.","Some Sadducees, who believed people would not rise from the dead, came to Jesus.","They asked, “Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.","Once there were seven brothers. The first brother married and died, but had no children.","Then the second brother married the widow, and he died.","And the third brother married the widow, and he died. The same thing happened with all seven brothers; they died and had no children.","Finally, the woman died also.","Since all seven brothers had married her, whose wife will she be when people rise from the dead?”","Jesus said to them, “On earth, people marry and are given to someone to marry.","But those who will be worthy to be raised from the dead and live again will not marry, nor will they be given to someone to marry.","In that life they are like angels and cannot die. They are children of God, because they have been raised from the dead.","Even Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life.

Pray that you will be strong enough to escape all these things that will happen and that you will be able to stand before the Son of Man.”","During the day, Jesus taught the people in the Temple, and at night he went out of the city and stayed on the Mount of Olives.","Every morning all the people got up early to go to the Temple to listen to him."],["It was almost time for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover Feast.","The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a way to kill Jesus, because they were afraid of the people.","Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles.","Judas went to the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple and talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them.","They were pleased and agreed to give Judas money.","He agreed and watched for the best time to hand Jesus over to them when he was away from the crowd.","The Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lambs had to be sacrificed.","Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.”","They asked, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”","Jesus said to them, “After you go into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters,","and tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover meal with my followers?”’","Then he will show you a large, furnished room upstairs. Prepare the Passover meal there.”","So Peter and John left and found everything as Jesus had said. And they prepared the Passover meal.","When the time came, Jesus and the apostles were sitting at the table.","He said to them, “I wanted very much to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.","I will not eat another Passover meal until it is given its true meaning in the kingdom of God.”","Then Jesus took a cup, gave thanks, and said, “Take this cup and share it among yourselves.","I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine(a) until God’s kingdom comes.”","Then Jesus took some bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to the apostles, saying, “This is my body,(b) which I am giving for you. Do this to remember me.”","In the same way, after supper, Jesus took the cup and said, “This cup is the new agreement that God makes with his people. This new agreement begins with my blood which is poured out for you.\nWho Will Turn Against Jesus?","“But one of you will turn against me, and his hand is with mine on the table.","What God has planned for the Son of Man will happen, but how terrible it will be for that one who turns against the Son of Man.”","Then the apostles asked each other which one of them would do that.","The apostles also began to argue about which one of them was the most important.","But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the non - Jewish people rule over them, and those who have authority over others like to be called ‘friends of the people.’","But you must not be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the leader should be like the servant.","Who is more important: the one sitting at the table or the one serving? You think the one at the table is more important, but I am like a servant among you.","“You have stayed with me through my struggles.","Just as my Father has given me a kingdom, I also give you a kingdom","so you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. And you will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\nDon’t Lose Your Faith!","“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to test all of you as a farmer sifts his wheat.","I have prayed that you will not lose your faith! Help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me.”","But Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and even to die with you!”","But Jesus said, “Peter, before the rooster crows this day, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”","Then Jesus said to the apostles, “When I sent you out without a purse, a bag, or sandals, did you need anything?”\nThey said, “No.”","He said to them, “But now if you have a purse or a bag, carry that with you. If you don’t have a sword, sell your coat and buy one.","The Scripture says, ‘He was treated like a criminal,’(c) and I tell you this scripture must have its full meaning. It was written about me, and it is happening now.”","His followers said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”\nHe said to them, “That is enough.”","Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives, as he often did, and his followers went with him.","When he reached the place, he said to them, “Pray for strength against temptation.”","Then Jesus went about a stone’s throw away from them. He kneeled down and prayed,","“Father, if you are willing, take away this cup(d) of suffering. But do what you want, not what I want.”","Then an angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him.","Being full of pain, Jesus prayed even harder. His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.","When he finished praying, he went to his followers and found them asleep because of their sadness.","Jesus said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray for strength against temptation.”","While Jesus was speaking, a crowd came up, and Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was leading them. He came close to Jesus so he could kiss him.","But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you using the kiss to give the Son of Man to his enemies?”","When those who were standing around him saw what was happening, they said, “Lord, should we strike them with our swords?”","And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.","Jesus said, “Stop! No more of this.” Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him.","Those who came to arrest Jesus were the leading priests, the soldiers who guarded the Temple, and the elders. Jesus said to them, “You came out here with swords and clubs as though I were a criminal.","I was with you every day in the Temple, and you didn’t arrest me there. But this is your time - the time when darkness rules.”","They arrested Jesus, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed far behind them.","After the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat together, Peter sat with them.","A servant girl saw Peter sitting there in the firelight, and looking closely at him, she said, “This man was also with him.”","But Peter said this was not true; he said, “Woman, I don’t know him.”","A short time later, another person saw Peter and said, “You are also one of them.”\nBut Peter said, “Man, I am not!”","About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with him, because he is from Galilee, too.”","But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!”\nAt once, while Peter was still speaking, a rooster crowed.","Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. And Peter remembered what the Lord had said: “Before the rooster crows this day, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”","Then Peter went outside and cried painfully.","The men who were guarding Jesus began making fun of him and beating him.","They blindfolded him and said, “Prove that you are a prophet, and tell us who hit you.”","They said many cruel things to Jesus.","When day came, the council of the elders of the people, both the leading priests and the teachers of the law, came together and led Jesus to their highest court.","They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”\nJesus said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe me.","And if I ask you, you will not answer.","But from now on, the Son of Man will sit at the right hand of the powerful God.”","They all said, “Then are you the Son of God?”\nJesus said to them, “You say that I am.”","They said, “Why do we need witnesses now? We ourselves heard him say this.”"],["Then the whole group stood up and led Jesus to Pilate.(e)","They began to accuse Jesus, saying, “We caught this man telling things that mislead our people. He says that we should not pay taxes to Caesar, and he calls himself the Christ, a king.”","Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\nJesus answered, “Those are your words.”","Pilate said to the leading priests and the people, “I find nothing against this man.”","They were insisting, saying, “But Jesus makes trouble with the people, teaching all around Judea. He began in Galilee, and now he is here.”","Pilate heard this and asked if Jesus was from Galilee.","Since Jesus was under Herod’s authority, Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time.","When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to meet him for a long time. He was hoping to see Jesus work a miracle.","Herod asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus said nothing.","The leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there, strongly accusing Jesus.","After Herod and his soldiers had made fun of Jesus, they dressed him in a kingly robe and sent him back to Pilate.","In the past, Pilate and Herod had always been enemies, but on that day they became friends.","Pilate called the people together with the leading priests and the rulers.","He said to them, “You brought this man to me, saying he makes trouble among the people. But I have questioned him before you all, and I have not found him guilty of what you say.","Also, Herod found nothing wrong with him; he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing for which he should die.","So, after I punish him, I will let him go free.”","[Every year at the Passover Feast, Pilate had to release one prisoner to the people.](f)","But the people shouted together, “Take this man away! Let Barabbas go free!”","(Barabbas was a man who was in prison for his part in a riot in the city and for murder.)","Pilate wanted to let Jesus go free and told this to the crowd.","But they shouted again, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”","A third time Pilate said to them, “Why? What wrong has he done? I can find no reason to kill him. So I will have him punished and set him free.”","But they continued to shout, demanding that Jesus be crucified. Their yelling became so loud that","Pilate decided to give them what they wanted.","He set free the man who was in jail for rioting and murder, and he handed Jesus over to them to do with him as they wished.","As they led Jesus away, Simon, a man from Cyrene, was coming in from the fields. They forced him to carry Jesus’ cross and to walk behind him.","A large crowd of people was following Jesus, including some women who were sad and crying for him.","But Jesus turned and said to them, “Women of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me. Cry for yourselves and for your children.","The time is coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the women who cannot have children and who have no babies to nurse.’","Then people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ And they will say to the hills, ‘Cover us!’","If they act like this now when life is good, what will happen when bad times come?”(g)","There were also two criminals led out with Jesus to be put to death.","When they came to a place called the Skull, the soldiers crucified Jesus and the criminals - one on his right and the other on his left.","Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, because they don’t know what they are doing.”(h)\nThe soldiers threw lots to decide who would get his clothes.","The people stood there watching. And the leaders made fun of Jesus, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself if he is God’s Chosen One, the Christ.”","The soldiers also made fun of him, coming to Jesus and offering him some vinegar.","They said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”","At the top of the cross these words were written: this is the king of the jews.","One of the criminals on a cross began to shout insults at Jesus: “Aren’t you the Christ? Then save yourself and us.”","But the other criminal stopped him and said, “You should fear God! You are getting the same punishment he is.","We are punished justly, getting what we deserve for what we did. But this man has done nothing wrong.”","Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”","Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.”(i)","It was about noon, and the whole land became dark until three o’clock in the afternoon,","because the sun did not shine. The curtain in the Temple(j) was torn in two.","Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, I give you my life.” After Jesus said this, he died.","When the army officer there saw what happened, he praised God, saying, “Surely this was a good man!”","When all the people who had gathered there to watch saw what happened, they returned home, beating their chests because they were so sad.","But those who were close friends of Jesus, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance and watched.","There was a good and religious man named Joseph who was a member of the council.","But he had not agreed to the other leaders’ plans and actions against Jesus. He was from the town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God to come.","Joseph went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.","He took the body down from the cross, wrapped it in cloth, and put it in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock. This tomb had never been used before.","This was late on Preparation Day, and when the sun went down, the Sabbath day would begin.","The women who had come from Galilee with Jesus followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how Jesus’ body was laid.","Then the women left to prepare spices and perfumes.\nOn the Sabbath day they rested, as the law of Moses commanded."],["Very early on the first day of the week, at dawn, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.","They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb,","but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.","While they were wondering about this, two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them.","The women were very afraid and bowed their heads to the ground. The men said to them, “Why are you looking for a living person in this place for the dead?","He is not here; he has risen from the dead. Do you remember what he told you in Galilee?","He said the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and rise from the dead on the third day.”","Then the women remembered what Jesus had said.","The women left the tomb and told all these things to the eleven apostles and the other followers.","It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women who told the apostles everything that had happened at the tomb.","But they did not believe the women, because it sounded like nonsense.","But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Bending down and looking in, he saw only the cloth that Jesus’ body had been wrapped in. Peter went away to his home, wondering about what had happened.","That same day two of Jesus’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.","They were talking about everything that had happened.","While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and began walking with them,","but they were kept from recognizing him.","Then he said, “What are these things you are talking about while you walk?”\nThe two followers stopped, looking very sad.","The one named Cleopas answered, “Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know what just happened there?”","Jesus said to them, “What are you talking about?”\nThey said, “About Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet who said and did many powerful things before God and all the people.","Our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him.","But we were hoping that he would free Israel. Besides this, it is now the third day since this happened.","And today some women among us amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb,","but they did not find his body there. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive!","So some of our group went to the tomb, too. They found it just as the women said, but they did not see Jesus.”","Then Jesus said to them, “You are foolish and slow to believe everything the prophets said.","They said that the Christ must suffer these things before he enters his glory.”","Then starting with what Moses and all the prophets had said about him, Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures.","They came near the town of Emmaus, and Jesus acted as if he were going farther.","But they begged him, “Stay with us, because it is late; it is almost night.” So he went in to stay with them.","When Jesus was at the table with them, he took some bread, gave thanks, divided it, and gave it to them.","And then, they were allowed to recognize Jesus. But when they saw who he was, he disappeared.","They said to each other, “It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us.”","So the two followers got up at once and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven apostles and others gathered.","They were saying, “The Lord really has risen from the dead! He showed himself to Simon.”","Then the two followers told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Jesus when he divided the bread.","While the two followers were telling this, Jesus himself stood right in the middle of them and said, “Peace be with you.”","They were fearful and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost.","But Jesus said, “Why are you troubled? Why do you doubt what you see?","Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have a living body as you see I have.”","After Jesus said this, he showed them his hands and feet.","While they still could not believe it because they were amazed and happy, Jesus said to them, “Do you have any food here?”","They gave him a piece of broiled fish.","While the followers watched, Jesus took the fish and ate it.","He said to them, “Remember when I was with you before? I said that everything written about me must happen - everything in the law of Moses, the books of the prophets, and the Psalms.”","Then Jesus opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.","He said to them, “It is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day","and that a change of hearts and lives and forgiveness of sins would be preached in his name to all nations, starting at Jerusalem.","You are witnesses of these things.","I will send you what my Father has promised, but you must stay in Jerusalem until you have received that power from heaven.”","Jesus led his followers as far as Bethany, and he raised his hands and blessed them.","While he was blessing them, he was separated from them and carried into heaven.","They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem very happy.","They stayed in the Temple all the time, praising God."]],jn:[["In the beginning there was the Word.(a) The Word was with God, and the Word was God.","He was with God in the beginning.","All things were made by him, and nothing was made without him.","In him there was life, and that life was the light of all people.","The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered(b) it.","There was a man named John(c) who was sent by God.","He came to tell people the truth about the Light so that through him all people could hear about the Light and believe.","John was not the Light, but he came to tell people the truth about the Light.","The true Light that gives light to all was coming into the world!","The Word was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know him.","He came to the world that was his own, but his own people did not accept him.","But to all who did accept him and believe in him he gave the right to become children of God.","They did not become his children in any human way - by any human parents or human desire. They were born of God.","The Word became a human and lived among us. We saw his glory - the glory that belongs to the only Son of the Father - and he was full of grace and truth.","John tells the truth about him and cries out, saying, “This is the One I told you about: ‘The One who comes after me is greater than I am, because he was living before me.’”","Because he was full of grace and truth, from him we all received one gift after another.","The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.","No one has ever seen God. But God the only Son is very close to the Father,(d) and he has shown us what God is like.","Here is the truth John(e) told when the leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”","John spoke freely and did not refuse to answer. He said, “I am not the Christ.”","So they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”(f)\nHe answered, “No, I am not.”\n“Are you the Prophet?”(g) they asked.\nHe answered, “No.”","Then they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”","John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah:\n“I am the voice of one\n    calling out in the desert:\n‘Make the road straight for the Lord.’”\n(Isaiah 40:3)","Some Pharisees who had been sent asked John:","“If you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet, why do you baptize people?”","John answered, “I baptize with water, but there is one here with you that you don’t know about.","He is the One who comes after me. I am not good enough to untie the strings of his sandals.”","This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing people.","The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. John said, “Look, the Lamb of God,(h) who takes away the sin of the world!","This is the One I was talking about when I said, ‘A man will come after me, but he is greater than I am, because he was living before me.’","Even I did not know who he was, although I came baptizing with water so that the people of Israel would know who he is.”","Then John said, “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven in the form of a dove and rest on him.","Until then I did not know who the Christ was. But the God who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man; he is the One who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’","I have seen this happen, and I tell you the truth: This man is the Son of God.”(i)","The next day John(j) was there again with two of his followers.","When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”(k)","The two followers heard John say this, so they followed Jesus.","When Jesus turned and saw them following him, he asked, “What are you looking for?”","They said, “Rabbi, where are you staying?” (“Rabbi” means “Teacher”). He answered, “Come and see.” So the two men went with Jesus and saw where he was staying and stayed there with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.","One of the two men who followed Jesus after they heard John speak about him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.","The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him, “We have found the Messiah.” (“Messiah” means “Christ.”)","Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas.” (“Cephas” means “Peter.”(l))","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”","Philip was from the town of Bethsaida, where Andrew and Peter lived.","Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”","But Nathanael said to Philip, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”\nPhilip answered, “Come and see.”","As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said, “Here is truly an Israelite. There is nothing false in him.”","Nathanael asked, “How do you know me?”\nJesus answered, “I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip told you about me.”","Then Nathanael said to Jesus, “Teacher, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.”","Jesus said to Nathanael, “Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.”","And Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, you will all see heaven open and ‘angels of God going up and coming down’(m) on the Son of Man.”"],["Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,","and Jesus and his followers were also invited to the wedding.","When all the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”","Jesus answered, “Dear woman, why come to me? My time has not yet come.”","His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you to do.”","In that place there were six stone water jars that the Jews used in their washing ceremony.(n) Each jar held about twenty or thirty gallons.","Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled the jars to the top.","Then he said to them, “Now take some out and give it to the master of the feast.”\nSo they took the water to the master.","When he tasted it, the water had become wine. He did not know where the wine came from, but the servants who had brought the water knew. The master of the wedding called the bridegroom","and said to him, “People always serve the best wine first. Later, after the guests have been drinking awhile, they serve the cheaper wine. But you have saved the best wine till now.”","So in Cana of Galilee Jesus did his first miracle. There he showed his glory, and his followers believed in him.","After this, Jesus went to the town of Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and followers. They stayed there for just a few days.","When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast, Jesus went to Jerusalem.","In the Temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves. He saw others sitting at tables, exchanging different kinds of money.","Jesus made a whip out of cords and forced all of them, both the sheep and cattle, to leave the Temple. He turned over the tables and scattered the money of those who were exchanging it.","Then he said to those who were selling pigeons, “Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a place for buying and selling!”","When this happened, the followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures: “My strong love for your Temple completely controls me.”(o)","Some of his people said to Jesus, “Show us a miracle to prove you have the right to do these things.”","Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will build it again in three days.”","They answered, “It took forty - six years to build this Temple! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days?”","(But the temple Jesus meant was his own body.","After Jesus was raised from the dead, his followers remembered that Jesus had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the words Jesus had said.)","When Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast, many people believed in him because they saw the miracles he did.","But Jesus did not believe in them because he knew them all.","He did not need anyone to tell him about people, because he knew what was in people’s minds."],["There was a man named Nicodemus who was one of the Pharisees and an important Jewish leader.","One night Nicodemus came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we know you are a teacher sent from God, because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him.”","Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot be in God’s kingdom.”","Nicodemus said, “But if a person is already old, how can he be born again? He cannot enter his mother’s womb again. So how can a person be born a second time?”","But Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born from water and the Spirit, you cannot enter God’s kingdom.","Human life comes from human parents, but spiritual life comes from the Spirit.","Don’t be surprised when I tell you, ‘You must all be born again.’","The wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it, but you don’t know where the wind comes from or where it is going. It is the same with every person who is born from the Spirit.”","Nicodemus asked, “How can this happen?”","Jesus said, “You are an important teacher in Israel, and you don’t understand these things?","I tell you the truth, we talk about what we know, and we tell about what we have seen, but you don’t accept what we tell you.","I have told you about things here on earth, and you do not believe me. So you will not believe me if I tell you about things of heaven.","The only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the One who came down from heaven - the Son of Man.(p)","“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert,(q) the Son of Man must also be lifted up.","So that everyone who believes can have eternal life in him.","“God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.","God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.","People who believe in God’s Son are not judged guilty. Those who do not believe have already been judged guilty, because they have not believed in God’s one and only Son.","They are judged by this fact: The Light has come into the world, but they did not want light. They wanted darkness, because they were doing evil things.","All who do evil hate the light and will not come to the light, because it will show all the evil things they do.","But those who follow the true way come to the light, and it shows that the things they do were done through God.”","After this, Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea, where he stayed with his followers and baptized people.","John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People were going there to be baptized.","(This was before John was put into prison.)","Some of John’s followers had an argument with a Jew about religious washing.(r)","So they came to John and said, “Teacher, remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you spoke about so much? He is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”","John answered, “A man can get only what God gives him.","You yourselves heard me say, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am the one sent to prepare the way for him.’","The bride belongs only to the bridegroom. But the friend who helps the bridegroom stands by and listens to him. He is thrilled that he gets to hear the bridegroom’s voice. In the same way, I am really happy.","He must become greater, and I must become less important.","“The One who comes from above is greater than all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about things on the earth. But the One who comes from heaven is greater than all.","He tells what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says.","Whoever accepts what he says has proven that God is true.","The One whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God gives him the Spirit fully.","The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything.","Those who believe in the Son have eternal life, but those who do not obey the Son will never have life. God’s anger stays on them.”"],["The Pharisees heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more followers than John,","although Jesus himself did not baptize people, but his followers did.","Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about him, so he left Judea and went back to Galilee.","But on the way he had to go through the country of Samaria.","In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar, which is near the field Jacob gave to his son Joseph.","Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from his long trip, so he sat down beside the well. It was about twelve o’clock noon.","When a Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water, Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.”","(This happened while Jesus’ followers were in town buying some food.)","The woman said, “I am surprised that you ask me for a drink, since you are a Jewish man and I am a Samaritan woman.” (Jewish people are not friends with Samaritans.(s))","Jesus said, “If you only knew the free gift of God and who it is that is asking you for water, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”","The woman said, “Sir, where will you get this living water? The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with.","Are you greater than Jacob, our father, who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and flocks?”","Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,","but whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty. The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person, giving eternal life.”","The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water.”","Jesus told her, “Go get your husband and come back here.”","The woman answered, “I have no husband.”\nJesus said to her, “You are right to say you have no husband.","Really you have had five husbands, and the man you live with now is not your husband. You told the truth.”","The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.","Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”","Jesus said, “Believe me, woman. The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father.","You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand. We understand what we worship, because salvation comes from the Jews.","The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, and that time is here already. You see, the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him.","God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”","The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (Messiah is the One called Christ.) “When the Messiah comes, he will explain everything to us.”","Then Jesus said, “I am he - I, the one talking to you.”","Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”","Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She said to the people,","“Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did. Do you think he might be the Christ?”","So the people left the town and went to see Jesus.","Meanwhile, his followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something.”","But Jesus answered, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”","So the followers asked themselves, “Did somebody already bring him food?”","Jesus said, “My food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work.","You have a saying, ‘Four more months till harvest.’ But I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now.","Already, the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life. So the one who plants and the one who harvests celebrate at the same time.","Here the saying is true, ‘One person plants, and another harvests.’","I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work on. Others did the work, and you get to finish up their work.”(t)","Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman said: “He told me everything I ever did.”","When the Samaritans came to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, so he stayed there two more days.","And many more believed because of the things he said.","They said to the woman, “First we believed in Jesus because of what you said, but now we believe because we heard him ourselves. We know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”","Two days later, Jesus left and went to Galilee.","(Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country.)","When Jesus arrived in Galilee, the people there welcomed him. They had seen all the things he did at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, because they had been there, too.","Jesus went again to visit Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine. One of the king’s important officers lived in the city of Capernaum, and his son was sick.","When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son, because his son was almost dead.","Jesus said to him, “You people must see signs and miracles before you will believe in me.”","The officer said, “Sir, come before my child dies.”","Jesus answered, “Go. Your son will live.”\nThe man believed what Jesus told him and went home.","On the way the man’s servants came and met him and told him, “Your son is alive.”","The man asked, “What time did my son begin to get well?”\nThey answered, “Yesterday at one o’clock the fever left him.”","The father knew that one o’clock was the exact time that Jesus had said, “Your son will live.” So the man and all the people who lived in his house believed in Jesus.","That was the second miracle Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee."],["Later Jesus went to Jerusalem for a special feast.","In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches, which is called Bethesda(u) in the Hebrew language.(v) This pool is near the Sheep Gate.","Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool. Some were blind, some were crippled, and some were paralyzed [, and they waited for the water to move.","Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water. After the angel did this, the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had].(w)","A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty - eight years.","When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time, Jesus asked him, “Do you want to be well?”","The sick man answered, “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving. While I am coming to the water, someone else always gets in before me.”","Then Jesus said, “Stand up. Pick up your mat and walk.”","And immediately the man was well; he picked up his mat and began to walk.\nThe day this happened was a Sabbath day.","So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath. It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.”","But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”","Then they asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?”","But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, because there were many people in that place, and Jesus had left.","Later, Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him, “See, you are well now. Stop sinning so that something worse does not happen to you.”","Then the man left and told his people that Jesus was the one who had made him well.","Because Jesus was doing this on the Sabbath day, some evil people began to persecute him.","But Jesus said to them, “My Father never stops working, and so I keep working, too.”","This made them try still harder to kill him. They said, “First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, making himself equal with God!”","But Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing alone. The Son does only what he sees the Father doing, because the Son does whatever the Father does.","The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does. But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed.","Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he wants to.","In fact, the Father judges no one, but he has given the Son power to do all the judging","so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","“I tell you the truth, whoever hears what I say and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life. That person will not be judged guilty but has already left death and entered life.","I tell you the truth, the time is coming and is already here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will have life.","Life comes from the Father himself, and he has allowed the Son to have life in himself as well.","And the Father has given the Son the approval to judge, because he is the Son of Man.","Don’t be surprised at this: A time is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice.","Then they will come out of their graves. Those who did good will rise and have life forever, but those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty.","“I can do nothing alone. I judge only the way I am told, so my judgment is fair. I don’t try to please myself, but I try to please the One who sent me.","“If only I tell people about myself, what I say is not true.","But there is another who tells about me, and I know that the things he says about me are true.","“You have sent people to John, and he has told you the truth.","It is not that I need what humans say; I tell you this so you can be saved.","John was like a burning and shining lamp, and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while.","“But I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John. The things I do, which are the things my Father gave me to do, prove that the Father sent me.","And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like.","His teaching does not live in you, because you don’t believe in the One the Father sent.","You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. They do in fact tell about me,","but you refuse to come to me to have that life.","“I don’t need praise from people.","But I know you - I know that you don’t have God’s love in you.","I have come from my Father and speak for him, but you don’t accept me. But when another person comes, speaking only for himself, you will accept him.","You try to get praise from each other, but you do not try to get the praise that comes from the only God. So how can you believe?","Don’t think that I will stand before the Father and say you are wrong. The one who says you are wrong is Moses, the one you hoped would save you.","If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because Moses wrote about me.","But if you don’t believe what Moses wrote, how can you believe what I say?”"],["After this, Jesus went across Lake Galilee (or, Lake Tiberias).","Many people followed him because they saw the miracles he did to heal the sick.","Jesus went up on a hill and sat down there with his followers.",'It was almost the time for the Jewish <span style="text - decoration - line:line - through;">Passover</span> [Trumpets] Feast.\n<p><small class="footnotes">\n<strong>John 6:4 misidentifies Trumpets as Passover.</strong>\nThe event is in Bethsaida, 130+ km away from Jerusalem (at Passover everyone should be in Jerusalem by the Torah).\nAlso, Jesus is feeding the crowd with leavened bread (not allowed at Passover).\n</small></p>',"When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat?”","(Jesus asked Philip this question to test him, because Jesus already knew what he planned to do.)","Philip answered, “Someone would have to work almost a year to buy enough bread for each person to have only a little piece.”","Another one of his followers, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said,","“Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish, but that is not enough for so many people.”","Jesus said, “Tell the people to sit down.” There was plenty of grass there, and about five thousand men sat down there.","Then Jesus took the loaves of bread, thanked God for them, and gave them to the people who were sitting there. He did the same with the fish, giving as much as the people wanted.","When they had all had enough to eat, Jesus said to his followers, “Gather the leftover pieces of fish and bread so that nothing is wasted.”","So they gathered up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left from the five barley loaves.","When the people saw this miracle that Jesus did, they said, “He must truly be the Prophet(x) who is coming into the world.”","Jesus knew that the people planned to come and take him by force and make him their king, so he left and went into the hills alone.","That evening Jesus’ followers went down to Lake Galilee.","It was dark now, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The followers got into a boat and started across the lake to Capernaum.","By now a strong wind was blowing, and the waves on the lake were getting bigger.","When they had rowed the boat about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water, coming toward the boat. The followers were afraid,","but Jesus said to them, “It is I. Do not be afraid.”","Then they were glad to take him into the boat. At once the boat came to land at the place where they wanted to go.","The next day the people who had stayed on the other side of the lake knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his followers but that they had left without him. And they knew that only one boat had been there.","But then some boats came from Tiberias and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.","When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now, they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus.","When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Teacher, when did you come here?”","Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, you aren’t looking for me because you saw me do miracles. You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied.","Don’t work for the food that spoils. Work for the food that stays good always and gives eternal life. The Son of Man will give you this food, because on him God the Father has put his power.”","The people asked Jesus, “What are the things God wants us to do?”","Jesus answered, “The work God wants you to do is this: Believe the One he sent.”","So the people asked, “What miracle will you do?

So I went and washed, and then I could see.”","They asked him, “Where is this man?”\n“I don’t know,” he answered.","Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.","The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day.","So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”\nHe answered, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.”","So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day, so he is not from God.”\nBut others said, “A man who is a sinner can’t do miracles like these.” So they could not agree with each other.","They asked the man again, “What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened?”\nThe man answered, “He is a prophet.”","These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the man’s parents","and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”","His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.","But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”","His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders, who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided.","That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”","So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “You should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”","He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”","They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make you see again?”","He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers, too?”","Then they insulted him and said, “You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses.","We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”","The man answered, “This is a very strange thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.","We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him.","Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind.","If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”","They answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out.","When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, Jesus found him and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”","He asked, “Who is the Son of Man, sir, so that I can believe in him?”","Jesus said to him, “You have seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you.”","He said, “Lord, I believe!” Then the man worshiped Jesus.","Jesus said, “I came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that the blind(af) would see and so that those who see will become blind.”","Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked, “Are you saying we are blind, too?”","Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you keep saying you see, your guilt remains.”"],["Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the person who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.","The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","The one who guards the door opens it for him. And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he brings all his sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.","But they will never follow a stranger. They will run away from him because they don’t know his voice.”","Jesus told the people this story, but they did not understand what it meant.","So Jesus said again, “I tell you the truth, I am the door for the sheep.","All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers. The sheep did not listen to them.","I am the door, and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture.","A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy, but I came to give life - life in all its fullness.","“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd who owns them. When the worker sees a wolf coming, he runs away and leaves the sheep alone. Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.","The man runs away because he is only a paid worker and does not really care about the sheep.","“I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me,","just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I give my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that are not in this flock, and I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock and one shepherd.","The Father loves me because I give my life so that I can take it back again.","No one takes it away from me; I give my own life freely. I have the right to give my life, and I have the right to take it back. This is what my Father commanded me to do.”","Again the leaders did not agree with each other because of these words of Jesus.","Many of them said, “A demon has come into him and made him crazy. Why listen to him?”","But others said, “A man who is crazy with a demon does not say things like this. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”","The time came for the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,","and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon’s Porch.","Some people gathered around him and said, “How long will you make us wonder about you? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”","Jesus answered, “I told you already, but you did not believe. The miracles I do in my Father’s name show who I am.","But you don’t believe, because you are not my sheep.","My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.","I give them eternal life, and they will never die, and no one can steal them out of my hand.","My Father gave my sheep to me. He is greater than all, and no person can steal my sheep out of my Father’s hand.","The Father and I are one.”","Again some of the people picked up stones to kill Jesus.","But he said to them, “I have done many good works from the Father. Which of these good works are you killing me for?”","They answered, “We are not killing you because of any good work you did, but because you speak against God. You are only a human, but you say you are the same as God!”","Jesus answered, “It is written in your law that God said, ‘I said, you are gods.’(ag)","This Scripture called those people gods who received God’s message, and Scripture is always true.","So why do you say that I speak against God because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’? I am the one God chose and sent into the world.","If I don’t do what my Father does, then don’t believe me.","But if I do what my Father does, even though you don’t believe in me, believe what I do. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”","They tried to take Jesus again, but he escaped from them.","Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had first baptized. Jesus stayed there,","and many people came to him and said, “John never did a miracle, but everything John said about this man is true.”","And in that place many believed in Jesus."],["A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in the town of Bethany, where Mary and her sister Martha lived.","Mary was the woman who later put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. Mary’s brother was Lazarus, the man who was now sick.","So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”","When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not end in death. It is for the glory of God, to bring glory to the Son of God.”","Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.","But when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.","Then Jesus said to his followers, “Let’s go back to Judea.”","The followers said, “But Teacher, some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago. Now you want to go back there?”","Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the daylight, he will not stumble, because he can see by this world’s light.","But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles because there is no light to help him see.”","After Jesus said this, he added, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him.”","The followers said, “But Lord, if he is only asleep, he will be all right.”","Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead, but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping.","So then Jesus said plainly, “Lazarus is dead.","And I am glad for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe. But let’s go to him now.”","Then Thomas (the one called Didymus) said to the other followers, “Let us also go so that we can die with him.”","When Jesus arrived, he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days.","Bethany was about two miles from Jerusalem.","Many of the Jews had come there to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother.","When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed home.","Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.","But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask.”","Jesus said, “Your brother will rise and live again.”","Martha answered, “I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection(ah) on the last day.”","Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will have life even if they die.","And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Martha, do you believe this?”","Martha answered, “Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming to the world.”","After Martha said this, she went back and talked to her sister Mary alone. Martha said, “The Teacher is here and he is asking for you.”","When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Jesus.","Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him.","The Jews were with Mary in the house, comforting her. When they saw her stand and leave quickly, they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there.","But Mary went to the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”","When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying, he was upset and was deeply troubled.","He asked, “Where did you bury him?”\n“Come and see, Lord,” they said.","Jesus cried.","So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him.”","But some of them said, “If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, why couldn’t he keep Lazarus from dying?”","Again feeling very upset, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance.","Jesus said, “Move the stone away.”\nMartha, the sister of the dead man, said, “But, Lord, it has been four days since he died. There will be a bad smell.”","Then Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?”","So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me.","I know that you always hear me, but I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.”","After Jesus said this, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”","The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth, and a cloth around his face.\nJesus said to them, “Take the cloth off of him and let him go.”","Many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.","But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.","Then the leading priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council. They asked, “What should we do? This man is doing many miracles.","If we let him continue doing these things, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation.”","One of the men there was Caiaphas, the high priest that year. He said, “You people know nothing!","You don’t realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”","Caiaphas did not think of this himself. As high priest that year, he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation","and for God’s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one.","That day they started planning to kill Jesus.","So Jesus no longer traveled openly among the people. He left there and went to a place near the desert, to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his followers.","It was almost time for the Passover Feast. Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to do the special things to make themselves pure.","The people looked for Jesus and stood in the Temple asking each other, “Is he coming to the Feast? What do you think?”","But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he must tell them. Then they could arrest him."],["Six days before the Passover Feast, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus lived. (Lazarus is the man Jesus raised from the dead.)","There they had a dinner for Jesus. Martha served the food, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus.","Mary brought in a pint of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet, and then she wiped his feet with her hair. And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house.","Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ followers who would later turn against him, was there. Judas said,","“This perfume was worth an entire year’s wages. Why wasn’t it sold and the money given to the poor?”","But Judas did not really care about the poor; he said this because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the money box, and he often stole from it.","Jesus answered, “Leave her alone. It was right for her to save this perfume for today, the day for me to be prepared for burial.","You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.”","A large crowd of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany. So they went there to see not only Jesus but Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead.","So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus, too.","Because of Lazarus many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus.","The next day a great crowd who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming there.","So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus, shouting,\n“Praise(ai) God!\nGod bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord!\nGod bless the King of Israel!”\n(Psalm 118:25 - 26)","Jesus found a colt and sat on it. This was as the Scripture says,","“Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem!\n    Your king is coming,\n    sitting on the colt of a donkey.”\n(Zechariah 9:9)","The followers of Jesus did not understand this at first. But after Jesus was raised to glory, they remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.","There had been many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb. Now they were telling others about what Jesus did.","Many people went out to meet Jesus, because they had heard about this miracle.","So the Pharisees said to each other, “You can see that nothing is going right for us. Look! The whole world is following him.”","There were some Greek people, too, who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover Feast.","They went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”","Philip told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.","Jesus said to them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory.","I tell you the truth, a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make many seeds. But if it never dies, it remains only a single seed.","Those who love their lives will lose them, but those who hate their lives in this world will keep true life forever.","Whoever serves me must follow me. Then my servant will be with me everywhere I am. My Father will honor anyone who serves me.","“Now I am very troubled. Should I say, ‘Father, save me from this time’? No, I came to this time so I could suffer.","Father, bring glory to your name!”\nThen a voice came from heaven, “I have brought glory to it, and I will do it again.”","The crowd standing there, who heard the voice, said it was thunder.\nBut others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”","Jesus said, “That voice was for your sake, not mine.","Now is the time for the world to be judged; now the ruler of this world will be thrown down.","If I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people toward me.”","Jesus said this to show how he would die.","The crowd said, “We have heard from the law that the Christ will live forever. So why do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”","Then Jesus said, “The light will be with you for a little longer, so walk while you have the light. Then the darkness will not catch you. If you walk in the darkness, you will not know where you are going.","Believe in the light while you still have it so that you will become children of light.” When Jesus had said this, he left and hid himself from them.","Though Jesus had done many miracles in front of the people, they still did not believe in him.","This was to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said:\n“Lord, who believed what we told them?\n    Who saw the Lord’s power in this?”\n(Isaiah 53:1)","This is why the people could not believe: Isaiah also had said,","“He has blinded their eyes,\n    and he has closed their minds.\nOtherwise they would see with their eyes\n    and understand in their minds\n    and come back to me and be healed.”\n(Isaiah 6:10)","Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.","But many believed in Jesus, even many of the leaders. But because of the Pharisees, they did not say they believed in him for fear they would be put out of the synagogue.","They loved praise from people more than praise from God.","Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me.","Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me.","I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not stay in darkness.","“Anyone who hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge, because I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.","There is a judge for those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept my words. The word I have taught will be their judge on the last day.","The things I taught were not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach.","And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands. So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say.”"],["It was almost time for the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. He had always loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them all the way to the end.","Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal. The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to turn against Jesus.","Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over everything and that he had come from God and was going back to God.","So during the meal Jesus stood up and took off his outer clothing. Taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist.","Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.","Jesus came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”","Jesus answered, “You don’t understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later.”","Peter said, “No, you will never wash my feet.”\nJesus answered, “If I don’t wash your feet, you are not one of my people.”","Simon Peter answered, “Lord, then wash not only my feet, but wash my hands and my head, too!”","Jesus said, “After a person has had a bath, his whole body is clean. He needs only to wash his feet. And you men are clean, but not all of you.”","Jesus knew who would turn against him, and that is why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”","When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and sat down again. He asked, “Do you understand what I have just done for you?","You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are right, because that is what I am.","If I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash each other’s feet.","I did this as an example so that you should do as I have done for you.","I tell you the truth, a servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who sent him.","If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.","“I am not talking about all of you. I know those I have chosen. But this is to bring about what the Scripture said: ‘The man who ate at my table has turned against me.’(aj)","I am telling you this now before it happens so that when it happens, you will believe that I am he.","I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send also accepts me. And whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me.”","After Jesus said this, he was very troubled. He said openly, “I tell you the truth, one of you will turn against me.”","The followers all looked at each other, because they did not know whom Jesus was talking about.","One of the followers sitting(ak) next to Jesus was the follower Jesus loved.","Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom he was talking about.","That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?”","Jesus answered, “I will dip this bread into the dish. The man I give it to is the man who will turn against me.” So Jesus took a piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.","As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered him. Jesus said to him, “The thing that you will do - do it quickly.”","No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas.","Since he was the one who kept the money box, some of the followers thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast or to give something to the poor.","Judas took the bread Jesus gave him and immediately went out. It was night.","When Judas was gone, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man receives his glory, and God receives glory through him.","If God receives glory through him,(al) then God will give glory to the Son through himself. And God will give him glory quickly.”","Jesus said, “My children, I will be with you only a little longer.

You must love each other as I have loved you.","All people will know that you are my followers if you love each other.”","Simon Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, where are you going?”\nJesus answered, “Where I am going you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.”","Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now?

That is why I said that the Spirit will take what I have to say and tell it to you.","“After a little while you will not see me, and then after a little while you will see me again.”","Some of the followers said to each other, “What does Jesus mean when he says, ‘After a little while you will not see me, and then after a little while you will see me again’? And what does he mean when he says, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”","They also asked, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand what he is saying.”","Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, “Are you asking each other what I meant when I said, ‘After a little while you will not see me, and then after a little while you will see me again’?","I tell you the truth, you will cry and be sad, but the world will be happy. You will be sad, but your sadness will become joy.","When a woman gives birth to a baby, she has pain, because her time has come. But when her baby is born, she forgets the pain, because she is so happy that a child has been born into the world.","It is the same with you. Now you are sad, but I will see you again and you will be happy, and no one will take away your joy.","In that day you will not ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you anything you ask for in my name.","Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy.","“I have told you these things indirectly in stories. But the time will come when I will not use stories like that to tell you things; I will speak to you in plain words about the Father.","In that day you will ask the Father for things in my name. I mean, I will not need to ask the Father for you.","The Father himself loves you. He loves you because you loved me and believed that I came from God.","I came from the Father into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”","Then the followers of Jesus said, “You are speaking clearly to us now and are not using stories that are hard to understand.","We can see now that you know all things. You can answer a person’s question even before it is asked. This makes us believe you came from God.”","Jesus answered, “So now you believe?","Listen to me; a time is coming when you will be scattered, each to your own home. That time is now here. You will leave me alone, but I am never really alone, because the Father is with me.","“I told you these things so that you can have peace in me. In this world you will have trouble, but be brave! I have defeated the world.”"],["After Jesus said these things, he looked toward heaven and prayed, “Father, the time has come. Give glory to your Son so that the Son can give glory to you.","You gave the Son power over all people so that the Son could give eternal life to all those you gave him.","And this is eternal life: that people know you, the only true God, and that they know Jesus Christ, the One you sent.","Having finished the work you gave me to do, I brought you glory on earth.","And now, Father, give me glory with you; give me the glory I had with you before the world was made.","“I showed what you are like to those you gave me from the world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your teaching.","Now they know that everything you gave me comes from you.","I gave them the teachings you gave me, and they accepted them. They knew that I truly came from you, and they believed that you sent me.","I am praying for them. I am not praying for people in the world but for those you gave me, because they are yours.","All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And my glory is shown through them.","I am coming to you; I will not stay in the world any longer. But they are still in the world. Holy Father, keep them safe by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they will be one, just as you and I are one.","While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power of your name, the name you gave me. I protected them, and only one of them, the one worthy of destruction, was lost so that the Scripture would come true.","“I am coming to you now. But I pray these things while I am still in the world so that these followers can have all of my joy in them.","I have given them your teaching. And the world has hated them, because they don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world.","I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to keep them safe from the Evil One.","They don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world.","Make them ready for your service through your truth; your teaching is truth.","I have sent them into the world, just as you sent me into the world.","For their sake, I am making myself ready to serve so that they can be ready for their service of the truth.","“I pray for these followers, but I am also praying for all those who will believe in me because of their teaching.","Father, I pray that they can be one. As you are in me and I am in you, I pray that they can also be one in us. Then the world will believe that you sent me.","I have given these people the glory that you gave me so that they can be one, just as you and I are one.","I will be in them and you will be in me so that they will be completely one. Then the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them just as much as you loved me.","“Father, I want these people that you gave me to be with me where I am. I want them to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the world was made.","Father, you are the One who is good. The world does not know you, but I know you, and these people know you sent me.","I showed them what you are like, and I will show them again. Then they will have the same love that you have for me, and I will live in them.”"],["When Jesus finished praying, he went with his followers across the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and Jesus and his followers went into it.","Judas knew where this place was, because Jesus met there often with his followers. Judas was the one who turned against Jesus.","So Judas came there with a group of soldiers and some guards from the leading priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons.","Knowing everything that would happen to him, Jesus went out and asked, “Who is it you are looking for?”","They answered, “Jesus from Nazareth.”","“I am he,” Jesus said. (Judas, the one who turned against Jesus, was standing there with them.)\nWhen Jesus said, “I am he,” they moved back and fell to the ground.","Jesus asked them again, “Who is it you are looking for?”\nThey said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”","“I told you that I am he,” Jesus said. “So if you are looking for me, let the others go.”","This happened so that the words Jesus said before would come true: “I have not lost any of the ones you gave me.”","Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)","Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back. Shouldn’t I drink the cup(ar) the Father gave me?”","Then the soldiers with their commander and the guards arrested Jesus. They tied him","and led him first to Annas, the father - in - law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.","Caiaphas was the one who told the Jews that it would be better if one man died for all the people.","Simon Peter and another one of Jesus’ followers went along after Jesus. This follower knew the high priest, so he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard.","But Peter waited outside near the door. The follower who knew the high priest came back outside, spoke to the girl at the door, and brought Peter inside.","The girl at the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of that man’s followers?”\nPeter answered, “No, I am not!”","It was cold, so the servants and guards had built a fire and were standing around it, warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.","The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and his teaching.","Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to everyone. I have always taught in synagogues and in the Temple, where all the Jews come together. I never said anything in secret.","So why do you question me? Ask the people who heard my teaching. They know what I said.”","When Jesus said this, one of the guards standing there hit him. The guard said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?”","Jesus answered him, “If I said something wrong, then show what it was. But if what I said is true, why do you hit me?”","Then Annas sent Jesus, who was still tied, to Caiaphas the high priest.","As Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said to him, “Aren’t you one of that man’s followers?”\nPeter said it was not true; he said, “No, I am not.”","One of the servants of the high priest was there. This servant was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off. The servant said, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?”","Again Peter said it wasn’t true. At once a rooster crowed.","Early in the morning they led Jesus from Caiaphas’s house to the Roman governor’s palace. They would not go inside the palace, because they did not want to make themselves unclean;(as) they wanted to eat the Passover meal.","So Pilate went outside to them and asked, “What charges do you bring against this man?”","They answered, “If he were not a criminal, we wouldn’t have brought him to you.”","Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.”\n“But we are not allowed to put anyone to death,” the Jews answered.","(This happened so that what Jesus said about how he would die would come true.)","Then Pilate went back inside the palace and called Jesus to him and asked, “Are you the king of the Jews?”","Jesus said, “Is that your own question, or did others tell you about me?”","Pilate answered, “I am not one of you. It was your own people and their leading priests who handed you over to me. What have you done wrong?”","Jesus answered, “My kingdom does not belong to this world. If it belonged to this world, my servants would have fought to keep me from being given over to the Jewish leaders. But my kingdom is from another place.”","Pilate said, “So you are a king!”\nJesus answered, “You are the one saying I am a king. This is why I was born and came into the world: to tell people the truth. And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me.”","Pilate said, “What is truth?” After he said this, he went out to the crowd again and said to them, “I find nothing against this man.","But it is your custom that I free one prisoner to you at Passover time. Do you want me to free the ‘king of the Jews’?”","They shouted back, “No, not him! Let Barabbas go free!” (Barabbas was a robber.)"],["Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped.","The soldiers made a crown from some thorny branches and put it on Jesus’ head and put a purple robe around him.","Then they came to him many times and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and hit him in the face.","Again Pilate came out and said to them, “Look, I am bringing Jesus out to you. I want you to know that I find nothing against him.”","So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”","When the leading priests and the guards saw Jesus, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”\nBut Pilate answered, “Crucify him yourselves, because I find nothing against him.”","The leaders answered, “We have a law that says he should die, because he said he is the Son of God.”","When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid.","He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus did not answer him.","Pilate said, “You refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have power to set you free and power to have you crucified?”","Jesus answered, “The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God. The man who turned me in to you is guilty of a greater sin.”","After this, Pilate tried to let Jesus go. But some in the crowd cried out, “Anyone who makes himself king is against Caesar. If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar.”","When Pilate heard what they were saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at the place called The Stone Pavement. (In the Hebrew language(at) the name is Gabbatha.)","It was about noon on Preparation Day of Passover week. Pilate said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”","They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”\nPilate asked them, “Do you want me to crucify your king?”\nThe leading priests answered, “The only king we have is Caesar.”","So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified.\nJesus Is Crucified\nThe soldiers took charge of Jesus.","Carrying his own cross, Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull, which in the Hebrew language(au) is called Golgotha.","There they crucified Jesus. They also crucified two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.","Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. It read: jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.","The sign was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Many of the people read the sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city.","The leading priests said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews.’ But write, ‘This man said, “I am the King of the Jews.”’”","Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”","After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, with each soldier getting one part. They also took his long shirt, which was all one piece of cloth, woven from top to bottom.","So the soldiers said to each other, “We should not tear this into parts. Let’s throw lots to see who will get it.” This happened so that this Scripture would come true:\n“They divided my clothes among them,\n    and they threw lots for my clothing.”\n(Psalm 22:18)\nSo the soldiers did this.","Standing near his cross were Jesus’ mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","When Jesus saw his mother and the follower he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Dear woman, here is your son.”","Then he said to the follower, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, the follower took her to live in his home.","After this, Jesus knew that everything had been done. So that the Scripture would come true, he said, “I am thirsty.”(av)","There was a jar full of vinegar there, so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ mouth.","When Jesus tasted the vinegar, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and died.","This day was Preparation Day, and the next day was a special Sabbath day. Since the religious leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day, they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken(aw) and the bodies be taken away.","So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man on the cross beside Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the man on the other cross beside Jesus.","But when the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.","But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus’ side, and at once blood and water came out.","(The one who saw this happen is the one who told us this, and whatever he says is true. And he knows that he tells the truth, and he tells it so that you might believe.)","These things happened to make the Scripture come true: “Not one of his bones will be broken.”(ax)","And another Scripture says, “They will look at the one they stabbed.”(ay)","Later, Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus. (Joseph was a secret follower of Jesus, because he was afraid of some of the leaders.) Pilate gave his permission, so Joseph came and took Jesus’ body away.","Nicodemus, who earlier had come to Jesus at night, went with Joseph. He brought about seventy - five pounds of myrrh and aloes.","These two men took Jesus’ body and wrapped it with the spices in pieces of linen cloth, which is how they bury the dead.","In the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb that had never been used before.","The men laid Jesus in that tomb because it was nearby, and they were preparing to start their Sabbath day."],["Early on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb while it was still dark. When she saw that the large stone had been moved away from the tomb,","she ran to Simon Peter and the follower whom Jesus loved. Mary said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him.”","So Peter and the other follower started for the tomb.","They were both running, but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.","He bent down and looked in and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in.","Then following him, Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen lying there.","He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head, which was folded up and laid in a different place from the strips of linen.","Then the other follower, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. He saw and believed.","(They did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from the dead.)","Then the followers went back home.","But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she bent down and looked inside the tomb.","She saw two angels dressed in white, sitting where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and one at the feet.","They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?”\nShe answered, “They have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have put him.”","When Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know it was Jesus.","Jesus asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Whom are you looking for?”\nThinking he was the gardener, she said to him, “Did you take him away, sir? Tell me where you put him, and I will get him.”","Jesus said to her, “Mary.”","Mary turned toward Jesus and said in the Hebrew language,(az) “Rabboni.” (This means “Teacher.”)\nJesus said to her, “Don’t hold on to me, because I have not yet gone up to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am going back to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”","Mary Magdalene went and said to the followers, “I saw the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.","When it was evening on the first day of the week, Jesus’ followers were together. The doors were locked, because they were afraid of the elders. Then Jesus came and stood right in the middle of them and said, “Peace be with you.”","After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. His followers were thrilled when they saw the Lord.","Then Jesus said again, “Peace be with you. As the Father sent me, I now send you.”","After he said this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.","If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven. If you don’t forgive them, they are not forgiven.”","Thomas (called Didymus), who was one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.","The other followers kept telling Thomas, “We saw the Lord.”\nBut Thomas said, “I will not believe it until I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side.”","A week later the followers were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. The doors were locked, but Jesus came in and stood right in the middle of them. He said, “Peace be with you.”","Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand here in my side. Stop being an unbeliever and believe.”","Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”","Then Jesus told him, “You believe because you see me. Those who believe without seeing me will be truly blessed.”","Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of his followers that are not written in this book.","But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. Then, by believing, you may have life through his name."],["Later, Jesus showed himself to his followers again - this time at Lake Galilee.(ba) This is how he showed himself:","Some of the followers were together: Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers.","Simon Peter said, “I am going out to fish.”\nThe others said, “We will go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.","Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the followers did not know it was Jesus.","Then he said to them, “Friends, did you catch any fish?”\nThey answered, “No.”","He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they did, and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat.","The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his coat around himself. (Peter had taken his clothes off.) Then he jumped into the water.","The other followers went to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about a hundred yards.","When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.","Then Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”","Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish, one hundred fifty - three in all, but even though there were so many, the net did not tear.","Jesus said to them, “Come and eat.” None of the followers dared ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.","Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, along with the fish.","This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead.","When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”\nHe answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”\nJesus said, “Feed my lambs.”","Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”\nHe answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”\nJesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”","A third time he said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”\nPeter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” Peter said, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you!”\nHe said to him, “Feed my sheep.","I tell you the truth, when you were younger, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands and someone else will tie you and take you where you don’t want to go.”","(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, “Follow me!”","Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who will turn against you?”)","When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”","Jesus answered, “If I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business. You follow me.”","So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, “If I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business.”","That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down. We know that what he says is true.","There are many other things Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."]],act:[["To Theophilus.\nThe first book I wrote was about everything Jesus began to do and teach","until the day he was taken up into heaven. Before this, with the help of the Holy Spirit, Jesus told the apostles he had chosen what they should do.","After his death, he showed himself to them and proved in many ways that he was alive. The apostles saw Jesus during the forty days after he was raised from the dead, and he spoke to them about the kingdom of God.","Once when he was eating with them, he told them not to leave Jerusalem. He said, “Wait here to receive the promise from the Father which I told you about.","John baptized people with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”","When the apostles were all together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, are you now going to give the kingdom back to Israel?”","Jesus said to them, “The Father is the only One who has the authority to decide dates and times. These things are not for you to know.","But when the Holy Spirit comes to you, you will receive power. You will be my witnesses - in Jerusalem, in all of Judea, in Samaria, and in every part of the world.”","After he said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their sight.","As he was going, they were looking into the sky. Suddenly, two men wearing white clothes stood beside them.","They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking into the sky? Jesus, whom you saw taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go.”","Then they went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. (This mountain is about half a mile from Jerusalem.)","When they entered the city, they went to the upstairs room where they were staying. Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon (known as the Zealot), and Judas son of James were there.","They all continued praying together with some women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and Jesus’ brothers."],["When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.","Suddenly a noise like a strong, blowing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.","They saw something like flames of fire that were separated and stood over each person there.","They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak different languages(a) by the power the Holy Spirit was giving them."]]},n=o(1).a.observable({timeline:[{"Before Jesus' Public Ministry":[["The Word Became
