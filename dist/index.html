So they took the water to the master.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>2:9</div>When he tasted it, the water had become wine.

Later, after the guests have been drinking awhile, they serve the cheaper wine.

The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person, giving eternal life.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:15</div>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:16</div>Jesus told her, “Go get your husband and come back here.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:17</div>The woman answered, “I have no husband.”
Jesus said to her, “You are right to say you have no husband.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:18</div>Really you have had five husbands, and the man you live with now is not your husband. You told the truth.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:19</div>The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:20</div>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:21</div>Jesus said, “Believe me, woman. The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:22</div>You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand. We understand what we worship, because salvation comes from the Jews.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:23</div>The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, and that time is here already. You see, the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:24</div>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:25</div>The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (Messiah is the One called Christ.) “When the Messiah comes, he will explain everything to us.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:26</div>Then Jesus said, “I am he-I, the one talking to you.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:27</div>Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:28</div>Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town.

Do you think he might be the Christ?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:30</div>So the people left the town and went to see Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:31</div>Meanwhile, his followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:32</div>But Jesus answered, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:33</div>So the followers asked themselves, “Did somebody already bring him food?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:34</div>Jesus said, “My food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:35</div>You have a saying, ‘Four more months till harvest.’ But I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:36</div>Already, the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life. So the one who plants and the one who harvests celebrate at the same time.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:37</div>Here the saying is true, ‘One person plants, and another harvests.’<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:38</div>I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work on. Others did the work, and you get to finish up their work.”(t)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:39</div>Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman said: “He told me everything I ever did.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:40</div>When the Samaritans came to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, so he stayed there two more days.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:41</div>And many more believed because of the things he said.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:42</div>They said to the woman, “First we believed in Jesus because of what you said, but now we believe because we heard him ourselves.

They said, “First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, making himself equal with God!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:19</div>But Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing alone. The Son does only what he sees the Father doing, because the Son does whatever the Father does.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:20</div>The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does. But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:21</div>Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he wants to.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:22</div>In fact, the Father judges no one, but he has given the Son power to do all the judging<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:23</div>so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father.

I judge only the way I am told, so my judgment is fair. I don’t try to please myself, but I try to please the One who sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:31</div>“If only I tell people about myself, what I say is not true.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:32</div>But there is another who tells about me, and I know that the things he says about me are true.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:33</div>“You have sent people to John, and he has told you the truth.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:34</div>It is not that I need what humans say; I tell you this so you can be saved.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:35</div>John was like a burning and shining lamp, and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:36</div>“But I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John. The things I do, which are the things my Father gave me to do, prove that the Father sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:37</div>And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:38</div>His teaching does not live in you, because you don’t believe in the One the Father sent.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:39</div>You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. They do in fact tell about me,<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:40</div>but you refuse to come to me to have that life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:41</div>“I don’t need praise from people.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:42</div>But I know you-I know that you don’t have God’s love in you.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:43</div>I have come from my Father and speak for him, but you don’t accept me.

Do those things here in your own town!’”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:24</div>Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:25</div>But I tell you the truth, there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah. It did not rain in Israel for three and one-half years, and there was no food anywhere in the whole country.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:26</div>But Elijah was sent to none of those widows, only to a widow in Zarephath, a town in Sidon.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:27</div>And there were many with skin diseases living in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha. But none of them were healed, only Naaman, who was from the country of Syria.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:28</div>When all the people in the synagogue heard these things, they became very angry.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:29</div>They got up, forced Jesus out of town, and took him to the edge of the cliff on which the town was built. They planned to throw him off the edge,<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>4:30</div>but Jesus walked through the crowd and went on his way.</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

When all the people said they had not touched him, Peter said, “Master, the people are all around you and are pushing against you.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:46</div>But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, because I felt power go out from me.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:47</div>When the woman saw she could not hide, she came forward, shaking, and fell down before Jesus. While all the people listened, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:48</div>Jesus said to her, “Dear woman, you are made well because you believed. Go in peace.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:49</div>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:50</div>When Jesus heard this, he said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid. Just believe, and your daughter will be well.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:51</div>When Jesus went to the house, he let only Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother go inside with him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:52</div>All the people were crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead, but Jesus said, “Stop crying. She is not dead, only asleep.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:53</div>The people laughed at Jesus because they knew the girl was dead.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:54</div>But Jesus took hold of her hand and called to her, “My child, stand up!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:55</div>Her spirit came back into her, and she stood up at once. Then Jesus ordered that she be given something to eat.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>8:56</div>The girl’s parents were amazed, but Jesus told them not to tell anyone what had happened.</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:47</div>The person who belongs to God accepts what God says. But you don’t accept what God says, because you don’t belong to God.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:48</div>They answered, “We say you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you. Are we not right?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:49</div>Jesus answered, “I have no demon in me. I give honor to my Father, but you dishonor me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:50</div>I am not trying to get honor for myself. There is One who wants this honor for me, and he is the judge.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:51</div>I tell you the truth, whoever obeys my teaching will never die.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:52</div>They said to Jesus, “Now we know that you have a demon in you! Even Abraham and the prophets died. But you say, ‘Whoever obeys my teaching will never die.’<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:53</div>Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died, too. Who do you think you are?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:54</div>Jesus answered, “If I give honor to myself, that honor is worth nothing. The One who gives me honor is my Father, and you say he is your God.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:55</div>You don’t really know him, but I know him. If I said I did not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey what he says.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:56</div>Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see my day. He saw that day and was glad.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:57</div>They said to him, “You have never seen Abraham! You are not even fifty years old.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:58</div>Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, before Abraham was even born, I am!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:59</div>When Jesus said this, the people picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid himself, and then he left the Temple.</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

          Jn 9:1-41
        </span></div> <div class="gospel-text" data-v-643906d3><div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:1</div>As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been born blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:2</div>His followers asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this man to be born blind-his own sin or his parents’ sin?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:3</div>Jesus answered, “It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him blind. This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:4</div>While it is daytime, we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:5</div>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:6</div>After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man’s eyes.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:7</div>Then he told the man, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam.” (Siloam means Sent.) So the man went, washed, and came back seeing.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:8</div>The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:9</div>Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No, he only looks like him.”
The man himself said, “I am the man.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:10</div>They asked, “How did you get your sight?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:11</div>He answered, “The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:12</div>They asked him, “Where is this man?”
“I don’t know,” he answered.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:13</div>Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:14</div>The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:15</div>So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”
He answered, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:16</div>So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day, so he is not from God.”
But others said, “A man who is a sinner can’t do miracles like these.” So they could not agree with each other.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:17</div>They asked the man again, “What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened?”
The man answered, “He is a prophet.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:18</div>These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the man’s parents<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:19</div>and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:20</div>His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:21</div>But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:22</div>His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders, who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:23</div>That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:24</div>So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “You should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:25</div>He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:26</div>They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make you see again?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:27</div>He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers, too?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:28</div>Then they insulted him and said, “You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:29</div>We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:30</div>The man answered, “This is a very strange thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:31</div>We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:32</div>Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:33</div>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:34</div>They answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:35</div>When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, Jesus found him and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:36</div>He asked, “Who is the Son of Man, sir, so that I can believe in him?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:37</div>Jesus said to him, “You have seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:38</div>He said, “Lord, I believe!” Then the man worshiped Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:39</div>Jesus said, “I came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that the blind(af) would see and so that those who see will become blind.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:40</div>Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked, “Are you saying we are blind, too?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:41</div>Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you keep saying you see, your guilt remains.”</div></div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-main" style="min-width:25em;max-width:0" data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-682a907b><div class="title" data-v-682a907b>Week 35-43 | Ministry In Judea</div> <div class="buttons" data-v-682a907b><span class="button-common" data-v-682a907b>–</span> <span class="button-common" data-v-682a907b>+</span></div></div> <div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

        </span></div> <div class="gospel-text" data-v-643906d3><div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:1</div>Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the person who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:2</div>The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:3</div>The one who guards the door opens it for him. And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:4</div>When he brings all his sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:5</div>But they will never follow a stranger. They will run away from him because they don’t know his voice.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:6</div>Jesus told the people this story, but they did not understand what it meant.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:7</div>So Jesus said again, “I tell you the truth, I am the door for the sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:8</div>All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers. The sheep did not listen to them.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:9</div>I am the door, and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:10</div>A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy, but I came to give life-life in all its fullness.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:11</div>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:12</div>The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd who owns them. When the worker sees a wolf coming, he runs away and leaves the sheep alone. Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:13</div>The man runs away because he is only a paid worker and does not really care about the sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:14</div>“I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me,<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:15</div>just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I give my life for the sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:16</div>I have other sheep that are not in this flock, and I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock and one shepherd.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:17</div>The Father loves me because I give my life so that I can take it back again.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:18</div>No one takes it away from me; I give my own life freely. I have the right to give my life, and I have the right to take it back. This is what my Father commanded me to do.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:19</div>Again the leaders did not agree with each other because of these words of Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:20</div>Many of them said, “A demon has come into him and made him crazy. Why listen to him?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>10:21</div>But others said, “A man who is crazy with a demon does not say things like this.

It is for the glory of God, to bring glory to the Son of God.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:5</div>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:6</div>But when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:7</div>Then Jesus said to his followers, “Let’s go back to Judea.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:8</div>The followers said, “But Teacher, some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago. Now you want to go back there?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:9</div>Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the daylight, he will not stumble, because he can see by this world’s light.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:10</div>But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles because there is no light to help him see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:11</div>After Jesus said this, he added, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:12</div>The followers said, “But Lord, if he is only asleep, he will be all right.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:13</div>Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead, but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:14</div>So then Jesus said plainly, “Lazarus is dead.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:15</div>And I am glad for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe. But let’s go to him now.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:16</div>Then Thomas (the one called Didymus) said to the other followers, “Let us also go so that we can die with him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:17</div>When Jesus arrived, he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:18</div>Bethany was about two miles from Jerusalem.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:19</div>Many of the Jews had come there to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:20</div>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed home.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:21</div>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:22</div>But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:23</div>Jesus said, “Your brother will rise and live again.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:24</div>Martha answered, “I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection(ah) on the last day.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:25</div>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will have life even if they die.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:26</div>And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Martha, do you believe this?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:27</div>Martha answered, “Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming to the world.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:28</div>After Martha said this, she went back and talked to her sister Mary alone. Martha said, “The Teacher is here and he is asking for you.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:29</div>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:30</div>Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:31</div>The Jews were with Mary in the house, comforting her. When they saw her stand and leave quickly, they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:32</div>But Mary went to the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:33</div>When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying, he was upset and was deeply troubled.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:34</div>He asked, “Where did you bury him?”
“Come and see, Lord,” they said.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:35</div>Jesus cried.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:36</div>So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:37</div>But some of them said, “If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, why couldn’t he keep Lazarus from dying?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:38</div>Again feeling very upset, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:39</div>Jesus said, “Move the stone away.”
Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, “But, Lord, it has been four days since he died. There will be a bad smell.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:40</div>Then Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:41</div>So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:42</div>I know that you always hear me, but I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:43</div>After Jesus said this, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:44</div>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth, and a cloth around his face.
Jesus said to them, “Take the cloth off of him and let him go.”</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

They asked, “What should we do? This man is doing many miracles.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:48</div>If we let him continue doing these things, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:49</div>One of the men there was Caiaphas, the high priest that year. He said, “You people know nothing!<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:50</div>You don’t realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:51</div>Caiaphas did not think of this himself. As high priest that year, he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:52</div>and for God’s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:53</div>That day they started planning to kill Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:54</div>So Jesus no longer traveled openly among the people. He left there and went to a place near the desert, to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his followers.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:55</div>It was almost time for the Passover Feast. Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to do the special things to make themselves pure.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:56</div>The people looked for Jesus and stood in the Temple asking each other, “Is he coming to the Feast? What do you think?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:57</div>But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he must tell them. Then they could arrest him.</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>

(Isaiah 6:10)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:41</div>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:42</div>But many believed in Jesus, even many of the leaders. But because of the Pharisees, they did not say they believed in him for fear they would be put out of the synagogue.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:43</div>They loved praise from people more than praise from God.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:44</div>Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:45</div>Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:46</div>I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not stay in darkness.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:47</div>“Anyone who hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge, because I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:48</div>There is a judge for those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept my words. The word I have taught will be their judge on the last day.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:49</div>The things I taught were not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>12:50</div>And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands. So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say.”</div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-643906d3 data-v-682a907b><div class="header" data-v-643906d3>
