This happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet: “I called my son out of Egypt.”(g)<div class="verse-ref"><div>MT</div>2:16</div>When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him, he was furious.

    of painful crying and deep sadness:
Rachel crying for her children.
    She refused to be comforted,

He answered, “No, I am not.”
“Are you the Prophet?”(g) they asked.

“This is a voice of one

John said to them, “Don’t force people to give you money, and don’t lie about them.

Jesus was tired from his long trip, so he sat down beside the well. It was about twelve o’clock noon.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:7</div>When a Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water, Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:8</div>(This happened while Jesus’ followers were in town buying some food.)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:9</div>The woman said, “I am surprised that you ask me for a drink, since you are a Jewish man and I am a Samaritan woman.” (Jewish people are not friends with Samaritans.(s))<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:10</div>Jesus said, “If you only knew the free gift of God and who it is that is asking you for water, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:11</div>The woman said, “Sir, where will you get this living water? The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:12</div>Are you greater than Jacob, our father, who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and flocks?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:13</div>Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:14</div>but whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty. The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person, giving eternal life.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:15</div>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:16</div>Jesus told her, “Go get your husband and come back here.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:17</div>The woman answered, “I have no husband.”
Jesus said to her, “You are right to say you have no husband.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:18</div>Really you have had five husbands, and the man you live with now is not your husband. You told the truth.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:19</div>The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:20</div>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:21</div>Jesus said, “Believe me, woman. The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:22</div>You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand. We understand what we worship, because salvation comes from the Jews.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:23</div>The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, and that time is here already. You see, the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:24</div>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:25</div>The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (Messiah is the One called Christ.) “When the Messiah comes, he will explain everything to us.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:26</div>Then Jesus said, “I am he-I, the one talking to you.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:27</div>Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:28</div>Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She said to the people,<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:29</div>“Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did. Do you think he might be the Christ?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:30</div>So the people left the town and went to see Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:31</div>Meanwhile, his followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:32</div>But Jesus answered, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:33</div>So the followers asked themselves, “Did somebody already bring him food?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:34</div>Jesus said, “My food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:35</div>You have a saying, ‘Four more months till harvest.’ But I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>4:36</div>Already, the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life.

After the angel did this, the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had].(w)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:5</div>A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:6</div>When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time, Jesus asked him, “Do you want to be well?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:7</div>The sick man answered, “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving.

The day this happened was a Sabbath day.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:10</div>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath.

They said, “First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, making himself equal with God!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:19</div>But Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing alone. The Son does only what he sees the Father doing, because the Son does whatever the Father does.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:20</div>The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does. But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:21</div>Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he wants to.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:22</div>In fact, the Father judges no one, but he has given the Son power to do all the judging<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:23</div>so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father.

The things I do, which are the things my Father gave me to do, prove that the Father sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:37</div>And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:38</div>His teaching does not live in you, because you don’t believe in the One the Father sent.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:39</div>You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. They do in fact tell about me,<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:40</div>but you refuse to come to me to have that life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:41</div>“I don’t need praise from people.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:42</div>But I know you-I know that you don’t have God’s love in you.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>5:43</div>I have come from my Father and speak for him, but you don’t accept me.

    and hear with their ears.
They might really understand in their minds
    and come back to me and be healed.’

And they knew that only one boat had been there.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:23</div>But then some boats came from Tiberias and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:24</div>When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now, they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:25</div>When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Teacher, when did you come here?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:26</div>Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, you aren’t looking for me because you saw me do miracles. You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:27</div>Don’t work for the food that spoils. Work for the food that stays good always and gives eternal life.

If we see a miracle, we will believe you. What will you do?<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:31</div>Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert. This is written in the Scriptures: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”(y)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:32</div>Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven; it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:33</div>God’s bread is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:34</div>The people said, “Sir, give us this bread always.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:35</div>Then Jesus said, “I am the bread that gives life.

This is what my Father wants.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:41</div>Some people began to complain about Jesus because he said, “I am the bread that comes down from heaven.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:42</div>They said, “This is Jesus, the son of Joseph. We know his father and mother. How can he say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:43</div>But Jesus answered, “Stop complaining to each other.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:44</div>The Father is the One who sent me. No one can come to me unless the Father draws him to me, and <strong>I will raise that person up on the last day</strong>.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:45</div>It is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’(z) Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:46</div>No one has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only he has seen the Father.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:47</div>I tell you the truth, whoever believes has eternal life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:48</div>I am the bread that gives life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:49</div>Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but still they died.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:50</div>Here is the bread that comes down from heaven.

This bread is my flesh, which I will give up so that the world may have life.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:52</div>Then the evil people began to argue among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:53</div>Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, you must eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood.

So whoever eats me will live because of me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:58</div>I am not like the bread your ancestors ate. They ate that bread and still died. I am the bread that came down from heaven, and whoever eats this bread will live forever.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:59</div>Jesus said all these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:60</div>When the followers of Jesus heard this, many of them said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept it?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:61</div>Knowing that his followers were complaining about this, Jesus said, “Does this teaching bother you?<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:62</div>Then will it also bother you to see the Son of Man going back to the place where he came from?<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:63</div>It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh doesn’t give life. The words I told you are spirit, and they give life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:64</div>But some of you don’t believe.” (Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would turn against him.)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:65</div>Jesus said, “That is the reason I said, ‘If the Father does not bring a person to me, that one cannot come.’”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:66</div>After Jesus said this, many of his followers left him and stopped following him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:67</div>Jesus asked the twelve followers, “Do you want to leave, too?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:68</div>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, who would we go to? You have the words that give eternal life.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:69</div>We believe and know that you are the Holy One from God.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:70</div>Then Jesus answered, “I chose all twelve of you, but one of you is a devil.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>6:71</div>Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was one of the twelve, but later he was going to turn against Jesus.

Others said, “No, he fools the people.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:13</div>But no one was brave enough to talk about Jesus openly, because they were afraid of the elders.</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Week 33 | The Ten Lepers</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>17:11</div>While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he was going through the area between Samaria and Galilee.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>17:12</div>As he came into a small town, ten men who had a skin disease met him there.

As the ten men were going, they were healed.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>17:15</div>When one of them saw that he was healed, he went back to Jesus, praising God in a loud voice.<div class="verse-ref"><div>LK</div>17:16</div>Then he bowed down at Jesus’ feet and thanked him.

How did he learn so much?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:16</div>Jesus answered, “The things I teach are not my own, but they come from him who sent me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:17</div>If people choose to do what God wants, they will know that my teaching comes from God and not from me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:18</div>Those who teach their own ideas are trying to get honor for themselves.

Is Jesus the Christ?<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:25</div>Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said, “This is the man they are trying to kill.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:26</div>But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him, and no one is trying to stop him. Maybe the leaders have decided he really is the Christ.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>7:27</div>But we know where this man is from.

They forced her to stand before the people.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:4</div>They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:5</div>The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this. What do you say we should do?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:6</div>They were asking this to trick Jesus so that they could have some charge against him.
But Jesus bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:7</div>When they continued to ask Jesus their question, he raised up and said, “Anyone here who has never sinned can throw the first stone at her.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:8</div>Then Jesus bent over again and wrote on the ground.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:9</div>Those who heard Jesus began to leave one by one, first the older men and then the others.

The person who follows me will never live in darkness but will have the light that gives life.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:13</div>The Pharisees said to Jesus, “When you talk about yourself, you are the only one to say these things are true. We cannot accept what you say.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:14</div>Jesus answered, “Yes, I am saying these things about myself, but they are true. I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don’t know where I came from or where I am going.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:15</div>You judge by human standards.

Jesus answered, “You don’t know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father, too.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:20</div>Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple, near where the money is kept. But no one arrested him, because the right time for him had not yet come.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:21</div>Again, Jesus said to the people, “I will leave you, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. You cannot come where I am going.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:22</div>So the Jews asked, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he said, ‘You cannot come where I am going’?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:23</div>Jesus said, “You people are from here below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don’t belong to this world.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:24</div>So I told you that you would die in your sins. Yes, you will die in your sins if you don’t believe that I am he.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:25</div>They asked, “Then who are you?”
Jesus answered, “I am what I have told you from the beginning.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:26</div>I have many things to say and decide about you.

Jesus said, “If you were really Abraham’s children, you would do(ae) the things Abraham did.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:40</div>I am a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God, but you are trying to kill me. Abraham did nothing like that.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:41</div>So you are doing the things your own father did.”
But they said, “We are not like children who never knew who their father was. God is our Father; he is the only Father we have.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:42</div>Jesus said to them, “If God were really your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and now I am here.

Are we not right?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:49</div>Jesus answered, “I have no demon in me. I give honor to my Father, but you dishonor me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:50</div>I am not trying to get honor for myself. There is One who wants this honor for me, and he is the judge.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:51</div>I tell you the truth, whoever obeys my teaching will never die.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:52</div>They said to Jesus, “Now we know that you have a demon in you!

Who do you think you are?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>8:54</div>Jesus answered, “If I give honor to myself, that honor is worth nothing.

This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:4</div>While it is daytime, we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:5</div>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:6</div>After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man’s eyes.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:7</div>Then he told the man, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam.” (Siloam means Sent.) So the man went, washed, and came back seeing.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:8</div>The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:9</div>Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No, he only looks like him.”
The man himself said, “I am the man.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:10</div>They asked, “How did you get your sight?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:11</div>He answered, “The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:12</div>They asked him, “Where is this man?”
“I don’t know,” he answered.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:13</div>Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:14</div>The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:15</div>So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”
He answered, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:16</div>So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day, so he is not from God.”
But others said, “A man who is a sinner can’t do miracles like these.” So they could not agree with each other.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:17</div>They asked the man again, “What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened?”
The man answered, “He is a prophet.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:18</div>These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the man’s parents<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:19</div>and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:20</div>His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:21</div>But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:22</div>His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders, who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:23</div>That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:24</div>So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “You should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:25</div>He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:26</div>They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make you see again?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:27</div>He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers, too?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:28</div>Then they insulted him and said, “You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:29</div>We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:30</div>The man answered, “This is a very strange thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:31</div>We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:32</div>Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:33</div>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:34</div>They answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:35</div>When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, Jesus found him and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:36</div>He asked, “Who is the Son of Man, sir, so that I can believe in him?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>9:37</div>Jesus said to him, “You have seen him.

When the worker sees a wolf coming, he runs away and leaves the sheep alone.

Mary’s brother was Lazarus, the man who was now sick.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:3</div>So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:4</div>When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not end in death. It is for the glory of God, to bring glory to the Son of God.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:5</div>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:6</div>But when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:7</div>Then Jesus said to his followers, “Let’s go back to Judea.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:8</div>The followers said, “But Teacher, some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago.

When she saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:33</div>When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying, he was upset and was deeply troubled.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:34</div>He asked, “Where did you bury him?”
“Come and see, Lord,” they said.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:35</div>Jesus cried.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:36</div>So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:37</div>But some of them said, “If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, why couldn’t he keep Lazarus from dying?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:38</div>Again feeling very upset, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:39</div>Jesus said, “Move the stone away.”
Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, “But, Lord, it has been four days since he died.

Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:42</div>I know that you always hear me, but I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:43</div>After Jesus said this, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>11:44</div>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth, and a cloth around his face.

Stop being an unbeliever and believe.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>20:28</div>Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>20:29</div>Then Jesus told him, “You believe because you see me. Those who believe without seeing me will be truly blessed.”</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Week 64-70 | The Ascension</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:6</div>When the apostles were all together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, are you now going to give the kingdom back to Israel?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:7</div>Jesus said to them, “The Father is the only One who has the authority to decide dates and times. These things are not for you to know.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:8</div>But when the Holy Spirit comes to you, you will receive power. You will be my witnesses-in Jerusalem, in all of Judea, in Samaria, and in every part of the world.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:9</div>After he said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their sight.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:10</div>As he was going, they were looking into the sky. Suddenly, two men wearing white clothes stood beside them.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:11</div>They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking into the sky? Jesus, whom you saw taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go.”</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Week 64-70 | The Followers Wait For The Holy Spirit By Praying Together</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:12</div>Then they went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. (This mountain is about half a mile from Jerusalem.)<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:13</div>When they entered the city, they went to the upstairs room where they were staying. Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon (known as the Zealot), and Judas son of James were there.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>25:14</div>They all continued praying together with some women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and Jesus’ brothers.</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Week 70 | The Holy Spirit Baptise The Followers</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>26:1</div>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>26:2</div>Suddenly a noise like a strong, blowing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>26:3</div>They saw something like flames of fire that were separated and stood over each person there.<div class="verse-ref"><div>Act</div>26:4</div>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak different languages(a) by the power the Holy Spirit was giving them.</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Jesus Encourages Peter</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:1</div>Later, Jesus showed himself to his followers again-this time at Lake Galilee.(ba) This is how he showed himself:<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:2</div>Some of the followers were together: Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:3</div>Simon Peter said, “I am going out to fish.”
The others said, “We will go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:4</div>Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the followers did not know it was Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:5</div>Then he said to them, “Friends, did you catch any fish?”
They answered, “No.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:6</div>He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they did, and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:7</div>The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his coat around himself. (Peter had taken his clothes off.) Then he jumped into the water.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:8</div>The other followers went to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about a hundred yards.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:9</div>When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:10</div>Then Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:11</div>Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish, one hundred fifty-three in all, but even though there were so many, the net did not tear.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:12</div>Jesus said to them, “Come and eat.” None of the followers dared ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:13</div>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, along with the fish.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:14</div>This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead.</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Jesus Triple Checks If Peter Regained His Faith</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:15</div>When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”
He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:16</div>Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”
He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:17</div>A third time he said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” Peter said, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you!”
He said to him, “Feed my sheep.<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:18</div>I tell you the truth, when you were younger, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands and someone else will tie you and take you where you don’t want to go.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:19</div>(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, “Follow me!”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:20</div>Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who will turn against you?”)<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:21</div>When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:22</div>Jesus answered, “If I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business. You follow me.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:23</div>So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, “If I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business.”<div class="verse-ref"><div>JN</div>21:24</div>That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down. We know that what he says is true.</div></div><div class="accordion-sub" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc data-v-53496944><div class="header" data-v-b78e28fc>Jesus Sends Out The Apostles To Everyone In The World</div> <div class="verses" style="display:none" data-v-b78e28fc><div class="verse-ref"><div>MT</div>28:16</div>The eleven followers went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.<div class="verse-ref"><div>MT</div>28:17</div>On the mountain they saw Jesus and worshiped him, but some of them did not believe it was really Jesus.<div class="verse-ref"><div>MT</div>28:18</div>Then Jesus came to them and said, “All power in heaven and on earth is given to me.<div class="verse-ref"><div>MT</div>28:19</div>So go and make followers of all people in the world.
